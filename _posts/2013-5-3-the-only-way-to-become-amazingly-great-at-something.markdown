<blockquote><p>“Only one who devotes himself to a cause with his whole strength and soul can be a true master. For this reason mastery demands all of a person.” <strong>&#8211; Albert Einstein</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Very often you&#8217;ll see blog posts or books teaching you to &#8220;master&#8221; a skill in only 10 days, or 3 days &#8230; in fact, it used to be 30 days but the time frame to master something seems to be shrinking rapidly.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve even seen tutorials claiming to teach a skill in just a few hours. Pretty soon we&#8217;ll be demanding to know how to do something in seconds.</p>
<p>Instant mastery of skills and knowledge! Hey presto!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the reality is something a little less magical. Or maybe that&#8217;s a fortunate thing.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s only one way to become good at something:</p>
<p>1. First, you must learn it by reading or listening to others who know how to do it, but most especially by doing.<br />
2. Then do some more. At this point, you&#8217;ll start to understand it, but you&#8217;ll suck. This stage could take months.<br />
3. Do some more. After a couple of years, you&#8217;ll get good at it.<br />
4. Do some more. If you learn from mistakes, and aren&#8217;t afraid to make mistakes in the first place, you&#8217;ll go from good to great.</p>
<p>It takes anywhere from 6-10 years to get great at something, depending on how often and how much you do it. Some estimate that it takes 10,000 hours to master something, but I think it varies from person to person and depends on the skill and other factors.<br />

Want to be a great writer? It&#8217;s possible to be great within a few years, if you have the God-given talent of Fitzgerald or Shakespeare, but most of us toil for over a decade and are still trying to get better. We&#8217;re still learning, to this day, and if we look back on our first few years of writing &#8212; of any kind &#8212; we&#8217;ll tell you we sucked (for the most part) back then.</p>
<p>Want to be a great blogger? Same deal. I&#8217;ve been doing it for almost three years, and I&#8217;m still only competent. <a href="http://daringfireball.net">Gruber&#8217;s</a> been doing it for, like, 7 years and he&#8217;s still only &#8230; well, he&#8217;s pretty great by now. You have to do it, make mistakes, learn, really begin to understand it, and someday, if you stick with it, you&#8217;ll be great.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no one who is great at his profession who hasn&#8217;t been doing it for at least 6 years &#8212; no designer, no programmer, no carpenter, no architect, no surgeon, no teacher, no musician, no artist &#8230; you get the point. I dare you to name one. Most have been doing it for over a decade, and are still looking to improve.</p>
<p>It takes desire, it takes drive, it takes lots and lots of doing.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s the thing: don&#8217;t get discouraged if you&#8217;re just starting out. Have fun, like we all did in the beginning. If you have fun, you&#8217;ll learn to love it, and THAT&#8217;S when it clicks. When you love something, you&#8217;ll want to do it all the time, sometimes late at night and often, you&#8217;ll jump out of bed and want to do it before you move your morning bowels.</p>
<p><strong>THAT&#8217;S how you get great. By loving it so much your morning bowel movement takes second seat.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Everybody has talent, it&#8217;s just a matter of moving around until you&#8217;ve discovered what it is.&#8221; <strong>&#8211; George Lucas </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Find that desire. Do it, don&#8217;t just read about it. Don&#8217;t buy a single product or book or magazine that claims to teach you something in minutes, hours, days. They&#8217;re lying to your face, with a hand in your pocket at the same time.</p>
<p>Do it, keep doing it, then keep doing it some more. It&#8217;s the only way to get great, but the good news: anyone can do it. It just takes some time and some doing. Hey presto.</p>
<blockquote><p>When the world says, &#8220;Give up,&#8221;<br />
Hope whispers, &#8220;Try it one more time.&#8221;<br />
