<h2 class="section-heading">Lacks Passion</h2>

<p>
	Education that is not helping or giving our children the opportunity to live life 
</p>

<p>Why should one's ability to find the area of a triangle decides the future of our children? What rights do schools or these generalized test have to decide whether or not someone can or cannot become something? How has our society comes to the point where it judges its own kinds based his or her ability to solve irrelavant question which does not make one's life better? I am so sick and tired of how our education system has strayed away from what education is supposed to do: <i>inspire.</i></p>

<p>Socrates, a well-known Greek philosopher, once said..</p>
<blockquote>Education is the kindling of a flame, not the filling of a vessel.</blockquote>

<p>How are we kindling our children by making them studying for what they do not love? By shoveling generalized test in their faces? how is that going to inspire them of passion, courage, integrity, or creativity in life? Humanity has put so much effort into making our children learn more and more yet never give a clear reason as to why they should or what purpose would these knowledge serve them or how to they should use that knowledge. All we care about is next job and next school. There is no real passion in learning the beauty of these knowledge. </p>

<p>
	So what we end up with is the society in which passion is not to be found. Everybody just does his or job without any desire to improve his or craft since there is no one to tell them what to do .. because there is no passion for it in the first place ... because it was not driven by the true thrist for knowledge by just smt that was told to do. How inspiring is that?
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Why rob the children's future?</h2>
<p>Who are we to judge students based on his ability to answer question in math, science, or English when a child is much more than that. Where is creativity? Where is integrity? We odd to look at a person wholistically rather than short-sightly. Right now have an industrialised system of education where all students must fit one mold and those who don't pay for it by being robbed of the education they deserved by being robbed of the social status they deserved by being devalue and dehumanized to point where some feel so bad about themselves that they want to give up life all together. Why isn't education helping students? Why judge a student with an unwholistic view of the student? Why rob them of their future? I do not believe the job of education is not to deprived them of their future. But rather to give them a future. We shouldn't be measuring kids on one standard but rather find what and where their stregnth and passion lays and build upon those rather having someone who could be the next world famous painter trying to be enstein. Each and everyone child has his color and we odd to respect that. And for education, it should do whatever it takes to give a student a good life not depriving them of one.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Who cares about goodness. We just want our students to be smart.</h2>

<h2 class="section-heading">Education should help not hinder</h2>

<h2 class="section-heading">Education has abandoned morality for productivity</h2>


<h2 class="section-heading">We have got our value's wrong. We should train the student to be good, smart, and confident kids not test takers.</h2>

<p>We prepare children to learn how to learn, not how to take a test</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">Let's revolutionize</h2>

<p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

<blockquote>The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

<p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Join us in our rally toward change!</h2>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
