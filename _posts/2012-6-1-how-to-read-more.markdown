<p>Reading a good book is one of my favorite things in the world.</p>
<p>A novel is a time machine, a worm-hole to different dimensions, a special magic that puts you into the minds and bodies of fascinating people, a transporter that lets you travel the world, a dizzying exploration of love and death and sex and seedy criminal underworlds and fairylands, a creator of new best friends.</p>
<p>All in one.</p>
<p>I read because I love the experience, because it is a powerful teacher of life, because it transforms me.</p>
<p>I am not the world&#8217;s most prodigious reader, but I do read daily and with passion.</p>
<p>Lots of people say they want to read more, but don&#8217;t know how to start.</p>
<p>Read this. It should help.<br />
<span id="more-8753"></span><br />
<strong>1. Don&#8217;t read because you should &#8212; read for joy</strong>. Find books about exciting stories, about people who fascinate you, about new worlds that you&#8217;d love to visit. Forget the classics, unless they fit this prescription.</p>
<p><strong>2. Carve out the time</strong>. We have no time to read anymore, mostly because we work too much, we overschedule our time, we&#8217;re on the Internet all the time (which does have some good reading, but can also suck our attention endlessly), and we watch too much TV. Pick a time, and make it your reading time. Start with just 10 minutes if it&#8217;s hard to find time &#8212; even 10 minutes is lovely. Try 20 or 30 if you can drop a couple things from your schedule.</p>
<p><strong>3. Do nothing but read</strong>. Clear all distractions. Find a quiet, peaceful space. It&#8217;s just your book, and you. Notice but let go of the urges to do other things instead of read. If you must do something else, have some <a href="http://mnmlist.com/tea/">tea</a>.</p>
<p><strong>4. Love the hell out of it</strong>. You&#8217;re not doing this to better yourself. You&#8217;re doing it for joy. Reading is magic, and the magic will change everything else in your life. Love the experience, and you&#8217;ll look forward to it daily.</p>
<p><strong>5. Make it social</strong>. Find friends who love to read, or find them online. There&#8217;s a world of readers on the Internet, and they&#8217;d be happy to make recommendations and talk about the books you&#8217;re all reading. Try a book club as well. Reading is solitary, but is also a social act.</p>
<p><strong>6. Make it a habit</strong>. Pick a trigger in your daily routine, and consistently read exactly after that trigger each day. Even if it&#8217;s just for 5-10 minutes. The more consistent you are, and the longer you keep the streak going, the stronger the habit will become.</p>
<p><strong>7. Don&#8217;t make it a chore</strong>. Don&#8217;t make it something on your todo list or schedule that you have to check off. It&#8217;s not part of your self-improvement plan. It&#8217;s a part of your Make Life More Awesome Plan.</p>
<p><strong>8. Give up on a book if it&#8217;s boring</strong>. Reading isn&#8217;t something you do because it&#8217;s good for you &#8212; it&#8217;s not like taking your vitamins. You&#8217;re reading because it&#8217;s fun. So if a book isn&#8217;t fun, dump it. Give it a try for at least a chapter, but if you still don&#8217;t love it, move on.</p>
<p><strong>9. Discover amazing books</strong>. I talk to other people who are passionate about books, and I&#8217;ll read reviews, or just explore an old-fashioned bookstore. Supporting your local bookstores is a great thing, and it&#8217;s incredibly fun. Libraries are also amazing places that are underused &#8212; get a card today.</p>
<p><strong>10. Don&#8217;t worry about speed</strong>. Speed reading is fine for some, but slow reading is great too. The number of books, and the rate of reading them, matters not a whit. It&#8217;s not a competition. You&#8217;re reading to enjoy the books, so take your time. It&#8217;s like enjoying good food, or good sex: better savored, not rushed.</p>
