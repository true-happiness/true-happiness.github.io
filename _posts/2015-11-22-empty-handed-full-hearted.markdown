<p>We often load ourselves up when we travel, because we want to be prepared for various situations. This burden of being prepared leaves us with our arms full, unable to receive whatever is there when we arrive.</p>
<p>It leaves us tired from carrying, so that we are not happy when we meet someone new on our travels.</p>
<p>What if we traveled with empty hands, ready to embrace new experiences, receive new foods, touch new people?</p>
<p>We might feel less prepared when we leave, but the preparedness is an illusion. Stuff doesn&#8217;t make us prepared. Having empty hands but a heart that is full of love leaves us prepared for anything.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t just apply to taking a trip, but to living each day. Each day is a journey, and we load ourselves up with material possessions, with tasks and projects, with things to read and write, with meetings and calls and texts. Our hands are full, not ready for anything new.</p>
<p>Drop everything, be <a href="http://zenhabits.net/embrace-chaos/">open to everything</a>.</p>
<p>Enter each day empty-handed, and full-hearted.</p>
