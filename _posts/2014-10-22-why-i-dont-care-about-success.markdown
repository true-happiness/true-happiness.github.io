<blockquote><p>&#8216;Try not to become a man of success, but rather try to become a man of value.&#8217; <strong>~Albert Einstein</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>A lot of people in my field write about how to be successful, but I try to avoid it. It&#8217;s just not something I believe is important.</p>
<p>Now, that might seem weird: what kind of loser doesn&#8217;t want to be successful?</p>
<p>Me. I&#8217;m that loser.</p>
<p>Obviously, the first problem with success is how you define success &#8230; is it becoming famous, rich, creating a world-changing business, coming up with an idea that changes people&#8217;s lives, helping others, being happy? So many people with values similar to mine would reject the traditional definitions of success: being rich or famous or having a best-selling book or creating a huge business is not all there is to life.</p>
<p>And those people are right, in my book. If all you&#8217;re striving for is money, you&#8217;ll do horrible things to get it. If all you want is a successful business, you&#8217;ll screw people over to get it. If all you want is fame, you&#8217;ll give up your dignity to achieve it.</p>
<p>I could probably get a book on the New York Times best-seller list if I really tried, but it&#8217;s not something I care enough about, and I know I&#8217;d have to do things I wouldn&#8217;t be happy doing in order to get there. I&#8217;d have to make promises I couldn&#8217;t deliver on, sell something to people who are looking for answers I don&#8217;t have, trick them into buying the book.</p>
<p>I could make a lot more money than I make now, if I capitalized on all the readers I have and pressured them into buying more things. But I don&#8217;t think buying a lot of things is a good thing, so I&#8217;d feel crappy doing that. It&#8217;s not worth it.<br />

<h3>Snake oil</h3>
<p>So those who teach you to be successful &#8230; they&#8217;ll share methods that are a bit shady sometimes. If not, often they sell you platitudes that sound good but are too vague to really mean anything.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve read many, many things on how to be successful (I can&#8217;t avoid finding them &#8212; they&#8217;re everywhere), and rarely will any of them really show you how to get where you want to go.</p>
<p>And when you don&#8217;t get there, you blame not the success system, but your own inadequacies.</p>
<h3>The deeper problem</h3>
<p>There are other problems, though. Whatever your definition of success, it&#8217;s something you&#8217;re looking for &#8230; something that exists in the future. It&#8217;s based on your desire to achieve something, your feelings that you&#8217;re not where you want to be.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why the snake oil salesmen are so &#8220;successful&#8221; &#8230; they capitalize on the feelings of inadequacies that other people have. I think that&#8217;s horrible.</p>
<p>But beyond that, the trap of striving for this future &#8220;success&#8221; &#8230; it&#8217;s never-ending. You strive for more, and then when you get it, you strive for more again. You&#8217;re never satisfied. People who have a billion dollars, for example &#8230; they&#8217;re successful, right? Why don&#8217;t they stop trying to make money, then? Why would they possibly need more than a billion dollars? How can you possibly spend that much? They strive to make more because there will never be enough. They&#8217;ll never be successful enough.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s true not just of the rich, but of anyone who strives for success. Striving is a condition that doesn&#8217;t have an end, unless you give it up.</p>
<h3>The real success</h3>
<p>I might have a lot of readers now on True Happiness, but I don&#8217;t feel that&#8217;s what makes me a success. I&#8217;ve been a success since Day 1, because even when I had zero readers, I was doing what I loved. Even when no one else would have called me a success (I really was a nobody then), I absolutely loved writing my posts, and though I don&#8217;t agree now with a lot of what I wrote back then (in 2007), I was happy.</p>
<p>Success isn&#8217;t about achieving something in the future, but about doing something right now that you love.</p>
<p>So doesn&#8217;t that mean I care about success? Well, sure, if you define success as whatever it is you care about, then of course you&#8217;re going to care about success. But then &#8220;success&#8221; really doesn&#8217;t have a meaning, does it? If it can mean anything, then it means nothing.</p>
<p>So forget about &#8220;success&#8221;, and just find joy, passion, love, awesome-ness right now, in this moment. *That* is a success you can achieve, without any self-help course, without any method. Just go out and do it.</p>
