	One of the worst fear of our lives is that we become meaningless. Whether this would be meaningless to oneself, meaningless to others, or meaningless to the world. Meaninglessness comes in various forms. The feeling of being useless, most evident in today society where everything is about productivity, to a feeling of inadequency. At True Happiness, this is an important concept to understand as often times, we, humans, equate our self-worth with our meaning. So let's dig a little deeper on this subject of meaninglessness to see where we could find True Happiness in this.

<p>One of the most reowned Theravada Buddhist Monk in Thailand, "Ajahn Chah," once asked his disciples if a wooden stick--just like the one in the picture above--is long or short. Some answered, "It is long." Some answered, "It is short." But Ajahn Chah's answer was not what one would unexpected. His answer is that the stick is neither long nor short. It is only long if we want it to be short. And it is short only if you want it to be long. Thus, the wooden stick is neither short or long. It is what it is. Only our want make it so.</p>

<p>Similarly, our life is the same as that wooden stick. <strong>We are as meaningless as how much meaningful we want to be.</strong> A rich person who want to be richer always feels he or she is not meaningful enough. So in a sense, he is "poor." A poor person who feels that he or she has all that he or she ever wants is in way "rich." It all depends on your want. If you want to be richer then immediately you are "poor." If you feel you already have more than you want then at that very moment you are "rich."

<blockquote>We are as meaningless as how much meaningful we want to be.</blockquote>

<p>The moment you want to be more meaningful is the moment that you have become meaningless. Those who feels they are already meaningful has no need to search for more meaning in their life. They are already happy and satisfied with life. They have finished looking for more meaning to fill the void of their meaninglessness.</p>

<p>Thus, to find true happiness is not to look for more meaning, but to stop looking for one.</p>

<p>Life, in essense, is incomparable to one another. Life is just is. You can compare all you want but at the end of the day how could you ever compare something so different to one another? So live and let live.</p>

We are as meaningless as we want to be. 


<p>meaning = self-worth</p>

<p>If you have studied Philosophy espeically on the topic of epistemology or the study of how we know what we know then you will know that meaning emernate from a function of difference. What I mean by that is </p>

<p>This is what I am going to tell you. First, it's ok to be meaningless.(decontructivist) Second, you are not meaningless.(constructivist)</p>

<p>People are looking for a meaningful life, but to truly live is not to look for one.</p>


<p>If you want to be meaningful, then you need to have what it takes to be meaningless.</p>

	Let's face it. I believe we are all born with the fear of being meaningless. We are so fearful that we will not have any meaning that we live our lives trying to add meaning to ourselves. We buy things we do not need to help boost our ego. We want to get that degrees so that we look better than our friends. We want to get that job so that we feel better about ourselves. Why? because we feel we still do not have enough.

<blockquote>It takes so little, so infinitely little, for someone to find himself on the other side of the border, where everything - love, convictions, faith, history - no longer has meaning. The whole mystery of human life resides on the fact that it is spent in the immediate proximity of, and even in direct contact with, that border, that it is separated from it not by kilometers but by barely a millimeter.<br><br>- Milan Kundera, The Book of Laughter and Forgetting</blockquote>

<p>
This fear of being meaningless has been with us since we were born and it is at the core of our existence.

	We can't even rest anymore since it is tied to a sense of meaninglessness. We can't even not have a salary. How much salary we make become how meaningful we are.

	But is being meaningful or useful in life
</p>


So why do we not want to be meaningless? What's wrong with being meaningless? I believe that the answer to this question is the fact that we were born with nothing to begin with.

So why do we fear meaninglessness?
How does meaningless cause us unhappiness?


<p>
	But we are born with nothing, and we will die with nothing. So actually whatever a little we have right now is already a plus. It is a gift just to be alive. It is a gift to be born healthy. Thus, it is not correct to assume that we are meaningless.

	It's ok to be meaningless. We were all born from being zero. 

	There are probably millions of infant motality  We have nothing to begin with. Why are we crying over something which is even already even better than when we are born. Many infants today die even before they get a chance to live. Why are we crying over our the bad luck despite being so lucky to live up until now?
</p>

<p>
	Meaning is, therefore, relative. Let's say you feel you are not rich enough. And you are unhappy about it. 

	Meaning is created by comparing one thing with another. It simply the difference between one thing and another. Meaning does not emernate from the thing itself.
