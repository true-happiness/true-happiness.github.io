<p>Human's innate ability to compare ourselves to others is perhaps the root of all sins in life. Knowing that I am better create a sense of pride, while knowing that I am less create a sense of jealousy. There is no ends to our comparison unless we stop to put any value into it.</p>

<p>What I mean by "no ends" is this. Let's say that I want to be better than others. Once you meet someone who is worse of than you are then you are happy. But in reality, that is rarely the case because there is always someone better than you. Always. Thus, when there is no happiness to be found in such desire of trying to look better than other people.</p>

<p>I used to be that kind of person where I enjoy being better than others. Every conservation I start, every word I speak reak a sense of pride and the desperate need to show off myself. If one does not see oneself objectively. It is most likely that this habit will never change. And that person would forever carry around this inferiority complex.</p>

<p>Since my happiness was to look better than others, I couldn't see how tiresome it is for me as well as those around me to put up with my own lack of confidence.</p>

<p>However, the more I reflect upon this "happines" I gain from being seen as better than others, the more I see its negative effects. First of all, it is tiresome to try to talk about how great you are in every context. And second, it is rather obnoxious for others who have to put up with my own insecurity. No one likes someone how only boast about himself. And worse, who always are they are better than you are. I simply can't be happy since my happiness is fleeting. It's the kind of happiness which is dependent upon whether or not the context allow me to feel as if I am "better" than others or not. What I eventually realise is that it is too hard to find happiness in that way. My happiness to look better didn't do anyone including myself any good except fulfilling the unfulfillable desire to look "better". Thus, I quit.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">How to Stop Comparing Yourself to Others</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Compare yourself today with yourself yesterday</li>
	<li>Knowing that that there is no ends to comparing yourself to others. You will never be satisfied. Because you satisfaction is relative to how others are.</li>
	<li>Better could mean worse and less doesn't always mean more. It all depends on which standard or perspective are you putting yourself against</li>
	<li>Seeing the negative effect it has on oneself and everyone around you.</li>
	<li>Reflect. Reflect. Reflect. As long as you are biased toward yourself and your ways of attaining happiness, you will not find true happiness. Thus, it is necessary to reflect often. Question yourself. And if possible, learn to be mindfulness of your actions to see whether they are driven by this unwholesome desire or the desire to prove yourself something. Know thyself and change yourself before it's too late!</li>
