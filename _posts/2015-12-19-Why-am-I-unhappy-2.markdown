<p>Human's innate ability to compare ourselves to others is perhaps the root of all sins in life. Knowing that I am better create a sense of pride or even arrogant, while knowing that I am less create a sense of jealousy toward the other. There is no ends to our comparison unless we stop to put any value into it.</p>

<p>What I mean by "no ends" is this. Let's say that I want to be better than others. Once I meet someone who is worse of than I am then I become happy because I feel am better. But in reality, there is always someone who is better than you. So there is no ends to this quest of wanting to be better than other people. There is simply no happiness to be found in such unwholesome desire of trying to look better than other people.</p>

<p>How did I know this? Well, because I used to be that kind of person. I used to enjoy being better than others. Every conservation I start, every word I speak leak a sense of pride and the desperate need to show off myself. If one does not see oneself objectively. It is most likely that this habit will never change. And that person would forever carry around this inferiority complex.</p>

<p>Since my happiness was to look better than others, I couldn't see how tiresome it was for me as well as those around me to put up with my own complex.</p>

<p>However, the more I reflect upon this "happiness" I gain from being seen as better than others, the more I see its negative effects. First of all, it is tiresome to try to talk about how great you are in every context. And second, it is rather obnoxious for others who have to put up with my own insecurity. No one likes someone who fill up the conversation only boasting about himself. I simply can't be happy since my happiness is fleeting. I needed someone to be better than at all time else I wouldn't be happy. When I feel like I am better than a person, I become happy. When that person or someone else become better than me then I become unsatisfied. It's the kind of happiness which is dependent upon whether or not the context allow me to feel as if I am "better" than others. What I eventually realise is that it is too hard to find happiness. My happiness to look better didn't do anyone including myself any good except fulfilling the unfulfillable desire to look "better". Thus, I quit.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">How to Stop Comparing Yourself to Others</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Compare yourself today with yourself yesterday</li>
	<li>Knowing that that there is no ends to comparing yourself to others. You will never be satisfied. Because you satisfaction is relative to how others are.</li>
	<li>Better could mean worse and less is sometimes more. It all depends on which standard or perspective are you putting yourself against</li>
	<li>Seeing the negative effect it has on oneself and everyone around you.</li>
	<li>Reflect. Reflect. Reflect. As long as you are biased toward yourself and your ways of attaining happiness, you will not find true happiness. Thus, it is necessary to reflect often. Question yourself. Why I am still unhappy? And if possible, learn to be mindfulness of your actions to see whether they are driven by this unwholesome desire or the desire to prove yourself something. Know thyself and change yourself before it's too late!</li>
