<blockquote>"And in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make." ― The Beatles</blockquote>

Everything is and can be the object of our love. When we exercise our capacity to love on anything at all--ourselves, love ones, stranger, work, pets or even an insect--we become love itself. 


This site is about finding True Happiness. And love is definitely one of the ways in which one could come to understand and experience True Happiness. But unlike the convention kind of romantic love, the kind of love we are talking about is an act of compassion and selflessness, to look beyond ourselves for the well-being of others without expecting anything in return. It is an act done entirely for the benefits of others. There is no exchange in this kind of love. It is not a give and take. We get nothing for it. It is a <strong>gift</strong> in its truest sense.

<!-- Many believe it never worth to do anything if it does not pay. Just like this website, I do not gain anything. Th
it's a waste of time for me to write these articles on True Happiness. Their logic is that if it does not generate income then it is a waste of time. But this website is not intented to be an exchange for me to gain something. It's simply an expression of love. It is to love others even though there is no guarantee or nothing in return. It is an investment in a relationship that may or may not work at all. It is a total blind shot in the dark which I hope will help someone in their life become happier.

<h2>Love is Happiness</h2>

Love is probably one of the strongest emotion. It dominates and dissipates all doubts, hates, politics, and the dramas of human's life. You will be surprised how quickly can love turn your day around. We always think that we would be happy if others love us. But what we do not realise is that we would be just as happy if we were to love others. So look no further to find True Happiness because <strong>True Happiness is in the very act of love.</strong>

Mother Teresa once said:

<blockquote>"Let no one ever come to you without leaving better and happier. Be the living expression of God's kindness: kindness in your face, kindness in your eyes, kindness in your smile."</blockquote>

We all have the capacity for love. So exercise it. And exercise it often epecially on those who you dislike. Exercise it on yourself and everything that come into your life until it becomes your nature to love.

When you look at someone, always ask the question of "How can I love?" or "How can I love this person?" Just in that very thought, you are already setting up yourself to be happy. Regardless of who he is she is, this is our only duty. It's perhaps the only attitude we all should have toward life. 

This task is not limited to others but it can be applied to anything at anytime. So you can also ask question like "How can I love myself?" or "What is the best thing to do for myself right now?" I have been waking up with the question of "How can I love today?" It's a great question to start the day.

<!-- We always want to be loved by others, but rarely do we want to love others. So let's change that.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

I would like to leave you with these beautiful and memorable quotes below which I believe better summarise my point about love and True Happiness.
