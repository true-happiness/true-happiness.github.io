<h2>Summary</h2>
Happiness is less about what life is and more about what you do with it.
<h2>Content</h2>
There will be a time in everyone's life where we think we are at the lowest point of our lives. We think to ourselves how we will never be able to succeed and achieve what we set out to do. We think to ourselves how miserable or unfortunate our lives have become. We see ourselves as failures, losers, and etc. The list goes on.

Yet, none of those negative thoughts are going to get us out of our misery. There is a famous quote which goes:
<blockquote>"Insanity Is Doing the Same Thing Over and Over Again and Expecting Different Results."</blockquote>
If we are miserable, drowning ourselves in our sorrow or in our fate will not improve the situation instead what we need is a change.

<h2>Taking action to change.</h2>
Change requires action. It doesn't have to be THE right action. It does not have to be drastic. It can even just be extremely small change. However, it has to be something which allows us to at the end of the day look back and feel proud that we did not succumb to our fate but actually did something to improve and take charge of our lives.

This, in short, is growth or progress. It is a key ingredient to turning our life around. And it is something we all need to do every day keep ourselves out of depression--the feeling/belief that we can't accomplish what we set out to do or that we are not in control of our situation which as a result leads us to take no action which in turn create a self-fulfilling prophecy cycle in the story of how we can't.
<h2>Change is possible but action is required.</h2>
Even if you don't feel like taking any action, you should train yourself to take it. Even if it entails you to step outside of your comfort zone, you should still do it. Even if the action does not give you any immediate benefit, you should try it. The key is to not do what you are already doing and expecting to get a different result because that would be insanity.

So get your ass out and change your life.
