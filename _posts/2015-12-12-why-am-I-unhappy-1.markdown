<blockquote>Happiness is like a string which ties us to that which we believe is our happiness.</blockquote>

<p>We, humans, have many things which our happiness is dependent upon whether it would be our wealth, health, or our love ones. Let's say for example that if you tie your happiness with being rich and accepted, then as long as you are not rich or accepted you can not be happy. Similarly, if you rest your happiness on your promotion then the promotion becomes the happiness which you have put outside of yourself.</p>

<p>
Nowaday, the society is pushing us to become more and more dependent on external things to make us happy-be it a new iphone, a big house, a good job, and beautiful wife, a degree from Harvard and on and on. Now imagine ourselves being tie to millions of these strings which we come to know as our &ldquo;happiness&rdquo;. What we soon realise is that &ldquo;happiness&rdquo; starts to become a spider webs which we are the preys. Each "happiness" is pulling us left and right to the point that it becomes impossible to attain any happiness or freedom in life.
</p>
<!-- So be careful where you place your happiness because that which you believe to be &ldquo;happiness&rdquo; will be your master and you will be its slave.
 -->
<p>The happiest man on earth does not rest his &ldquo;happiness&rdquo; on what he wants or hope from the reality. He rests his happiness with reality. And for that reason, he is already happiness as is.
</p>
<p>So what can we do to be able to manage our these ties of "happiness"? Below are the steps to simplifying your life!
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Question Your Happiness</h2>

For us who are new this journey, start small by examining what we want in life and what we considered to bring us happiness. Simplify your life and cut those unnessarily ties of &ldquo;happiness&rdquo;. 

As a practice, I suggest you to regularly review your life. I personally have a habit of writing a journal every night before going to bed to see what is bothering my mind. List them all out, question this list of what you called &ldquo;happiness&rdquo; then sort only ones that matter most to you. You will easily find many things which you desire yet they are unnecessary towards life and are, in some ways, even weighting you down from achieving what really matters. Is it all that important to be &ldquo;succesful&rdquo; in eyes of the others? Is being rich the answer to life? Is it worth it to trade your inner happiness for an outer one? Is my family comes first before my work? Slowly find out what matters to you most. Cut out any unnecessary wants. Eventually your life will feel lighter as you let go of those extraneous ties of "happiness."&nbsp;

<h2 class="section-heading">What to Take Away</h2>

<p>Happiness is like a wild horse. If you don't know how to ride then it will take you where ever it desires. Thus, to be able to master your happiness, you need to learn how. Happiness needs work.</p>

Nevertheless, we are learning to be happy. So how could it be a bad journey right? So enjoy your road toward it. Have fun learning it. I promise you it&rsquo;s a beautiful journey.</p>

<p>Knowing where your happiness truly belongs is a skill one which can be improve by learning to quickly identify where you have misplaced your happiness. This is what mindfulness is for. (Click <a href="/tags/practice-of-true-happiness/">here</a> to learn more about the practice of True Happiness.) Let go of unnecessary desires because the less ties of "happiness" we have the easier for us to find happiness in life.</p>
