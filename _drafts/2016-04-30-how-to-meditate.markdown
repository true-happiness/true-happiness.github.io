<blockquote>Meditation can be summarised in one word: "to know".</blockquote>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

To meditate is simply to know. Know in this sense is not knowing in our thoughts or knowing from reading, listening, or thinking but knowing in the meditation sense is to experience and be mindful of.

<strong>What do we know in meditation?</strong>

The objects that we must know in meditation is ourselves. The self can be divided into two parts: the mind and the body. But to further seperate the self in all its part we can seperate it into five parts which are body, consciousness, knowledge, thoughts, and feeling. These are the objects of meditations.

<strong>What do we do with our body, consciousness, knowledge, thoughts, and feeling?</strong>

Nothing. We simply watch and be with them. By being mindful of ourselves, we will come to know the Truth of ourselves as well as find True Happiness. To learn more about "Why Meditate?" and the goals of meditation, <a href="/2016/03/22/why-meditate/">Click Here.</a>

<h2>Types of Meditation</h2>

I will introduce you to two ways of meditation.

<ul>
	<li>Meditation in Daily Life</li>

			<li>yoyo</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Mindfulness with Breahting</li>
	<li>Walking Meditation</li>
</ul>

The most important type of meditation is not one in which most people believes. Most people have the conception of meditation as sitting down and closing our eyes and watch our breathing. Yes, this is meditation. But what good what it do to you or anyone if it does not help you in your daily life? Thus, the most important form of meditation is one which you practices in your normal everyday life.

Of course this does not mean that you shouldn't do mindfulness with breathing or walking meditation. In fact you should. 


Meditation comes in many different forms. However, 


However, I will teach you in details about two which I believe have greatly helped me in my path.

1. Mindfulness in Daily Life
	1. learn to be aware of your thoughts and emotions
	2. build up awareness in daily life
	3. learn to be mindful of your thoughts
	4. 

2. Mindfulness with breathing

	1. first find suitable spot.
	2. sit in comfotable position
	3. Know your breathe coming in and know your breathe coming out

tips
- meditation is like when you are trying to hold a chick in your hand. If you hold it too tightly, it will die. If you hold it too lose the chick will run away. Thus, you must find the perfect balance, to not assure too much control or too little. You must find that spot between having too much desire and having lack of.


When we do sitting meditation or mindfulness with breathing, we simply know the movement of the air moving in and out. 


3. Walking Meditation

What is mindfulness?

Mindfulness is simply to know. 

All in all, I could tell you all day about how something taste like; but for you to know how it actually taste you have to be the one who try it.

All in all, I could talk about why you should meditate; but in the end only you through meditation will find out for yourself why you should meditate.

This is not a knowledge you gain from reading a book. It is the knowledge you gain from within through practice.

Meditation is not things you do only at the center. You go to center to learn the basic. But you must also apply that to your daily life in order for it to have a practical and beneficial to our lives. It is something you practice at every moment, from dusk to dawn from dawn to dusk, it is something you should practice at all times.

Meditation must be practice regularly like when you want to start a fire. You can't pause until you generate enough heat for the wood to catch fire. Meditation is the same.
