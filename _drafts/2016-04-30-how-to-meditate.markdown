Meditation, unlike its the general conception, is not always sitting down and watch your breathing.

Meditation is not things you do only at the center. You go to center to learn the basic. But you must also apply that to your daily life in order for it to have a practical and beneficial to our lives. It is something you practice at every moment, from dusk to dawn from dawn to dusk, it is something you should practice at all times.


Meditation must be practice regularly like when you want to start a fire. You can't pause until you generate enough heat for the wood to catch fire. Meditation is the same.

<h2>How to Meditate?</h2>

Meditation comes in many different forms. However, I will teach you in details about two which I believe have greatly helped me in my path.

1. Mindfulness in Daily Life
	1. learn to be aware of your emotions
	2. build up awareness in daily life
	3. learn to be mindful of your thoughts
	4. 

2. Mindfulness with breathing

	1. first find suitable spot.
	2. sit in comfotable position
	3. 
When we do sitting meditation or mindfulness with breathing, we simply know the movement of the air moving in and out. 


3. Walking Meditation

What is mindfulness?

Mindfulness is simply to know. 

All in all, I could tell you all day about how something taste like; but for you to know how it actually taste you have to be the one who try it.

All in all, I could talk about why you should meditate; but in the end only you through meditation will find out for yourself why you should meditate.

This is not a knowledge you gain from reading a book. It is the knowledge you gain from within through practice.
