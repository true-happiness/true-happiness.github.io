Have you ever found yourself surrounded by people, who bring unpleasant vibes, pulling you into their endless poor judgments and decision-making, and you have no choice but to remain stuck with the fruit of their actions? In life, we sometimes cannot choose the people you meet, live, and mingle with. You might feel trapped inside a tornado, with little to no hope of ever escaping.
 
As unbearable the situation may be, there are ways to unlock the inner getaway to break yourself free, to safeguard your emotional health, and sanity. Right then and there. There are countless tactics to accomplish this, but here are some of the common ones that have worked for me.
 
1.     Think of death.

 

Of yourself. Of the ones you love. Of the ones you hate. Of you and all these people altogether. Of the very people you are trapped with.

 

Consider this very inescapable fact of life. No matter how everlasting the torture or pain you are experiencing, it does not go beyond death.

 

2.     Find a quiet room/corner/space.

 

Turn your face to the wall, gently close your eyes, sit comfortably and breathe slowly. Just simply relax. This is your space. This is your moment.

 

3.     A go-to, comforting thought(s).

 

Of your loved one, a sacred place, anything. If thinking of Dalai Lama often brings you a sense of relaxation and calm, use it. Practice it often so when you are deep in that hole of despair, the calm that arise with those thoughts can ease your pain.

 
Although these are quick and temporary fixes, we all need a remedy every now and then to get ourselves back up on our feet and keep living.
