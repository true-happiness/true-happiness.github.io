<p>There are times when life's enormity will be too overwhelming for us. There will be times in our lives where we have no idea how go on with our lives. There will be times with doubt, fear, and uncertainty will cloud our mind so much that we just could not rest or fall as sleep. In this age of information where we are always bombarded by others who try to tell us what we should want in life, it is difficult to live a simple life. "You have to get a degree in order to be happy." "You need a new phone in order to look good in front of your friends." "You need that big house in order to the so called 'successful people'." "You need to get married by this age or else it will be impossible afterward." On and on and on. Life is becoming harder to keep up with the things that we should want in life. 


The universality of what a good life is. 

 The best way to get your life back on track is to... </p>

 So what should one do when life is at a loss? Here are four simple steps getting some control back on your life.

 <h2>4 Steps to Get Your Life Back When It Is At a Loss.</h2>
<ul>
<p><strong>1. Stop</strong></p>

<p>
Thich Nhat Han, a famous Zen Master, wrote in his book "Present Moment Wonderful Moment" as follows:

<blockquote>One evening I return to my hermitage from a walk in the hills, and I found that all the doors and windows of the hermitage had been blown open. When I left the house, I hand't secured them, and a could wind blew through the house, opened the windows, and scattered the papers from the desk all over the room. Immediately I closed the dooers and the windows, lit a lamp, picked up the papers, and arranged them neatly on my desk. Then I started a fire in the fireplace, and soon the crackiling logs brought warmth back to the room.<br><br>
Somtimes in a crowd we feel tired, cold, and lonely. We may wish to withdraw to be by ourselves and become warm again, as I did at the hermitage sitting by the fire, protected from the cold, damp wind. Our senses are our windows to the outside world, and sometimes the wind blows and disturbs everything withing us.</blockquote>

 once depicted in a imagery of life as a small hut in a tonado. What do you do when the storm is here? You shut the windows and doors of your hut. This is exactly the same. We stop whatever 

The point of shutting is not to run away. It is not to hide. The point is to prepare and strength oneself. the point is to give oneself a place to start anew. If the storm is hitting your hut there is no way you will be able to manage anything in life.
</p>

<strong>2. Ask yourself what do you really want in life.</strong>

<p>The reason why we are sometimes confused with life is because we have too many wants which some are even conflicting with one another.
</p>



<strong>3. Simplify</strong>

<p>Having too much wants makes our live become too much to manage. As a rule of thumb, a simple life always lead to happiness.</p>
</ul>
