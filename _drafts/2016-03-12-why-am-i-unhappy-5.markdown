There will be times when life become too overwhelming. There will be times in our lives where we have no idea how go on with our lives. There will be times where doubt, fear, confusion, and uncertainty will cloud our minds. It's normal symptom especially in this age of information where we are constantly bombarded by the tales of what we should want in life. "You have to get a degree from college in order to be happy." "You need a new phone in order to look good in front of your friends." "You need that big house to be 'successful'." "You need to get married by this age or else it will be impossible afterward." On and on and on we are fed by what we believe would bring us happiness but instead of happiness it often often times left us with a sense inadequancy to life.

So what should one do when life is at a loss? Here are four simple steps getting back on your life back on track..

 <h2>4 Steps to Get Your Life Back..</h2>
<p><strong>1. Stop</strong></p>

<p>
Thich Nhat Han, a famous Zen Master, wrote in his book "Present Moment Wonderful Moment" as follows:

<blockquote>One evening I return to my hermitage from a walk in the hills, and I found that all the doors and windows of the hermitage had been blown open. When I left the house, I hand't secured them, and a could wind blew through the house, opened the windows, and scattered the papers from the desk all over the room. Immediately I closed the dooers and the windows, lit a lamp, picked up the papers, and arranged them neatly on my desk. Then I started a fire in the fireplace, and soon the crackiling logs brought warmth back to the room.<br><br>
Somtimes in a crowd we feel tired, cold, and lonely. We may wish to withdraw to be by ourselves and become warm again, as I did at the hermitage sitting by the fire, protected from the cold, damp wind. Our senses are our windows to the outside world, and sometimes the wind blows and disturbs everything withing us.</blockquote>

 once depicted in a imagery of life as a small hut in a tonado. What do you do when the storm is here? You shut the windows and doors of your hut. This is exactly the same. We stop whatever 

The point of shutting is not to run away. It is not to hide. The point is to prepare and strength oneself. the point is to give oneself a place to start anew. If the storm is hitting your hut there is no way you will be able to manage anything in life.

<strong>2. Understanding that it's ok to be lost.</strong>

<p>hyo</p>

<strong>2. Reorganise your life by sorting out your priorities.</strong>

<p>The reason why we are sometimes confused with life is because we have too many wants which some are even conflicting with one another.
</p>

<strong>3. Simplify</strong>

<p>Having too much wants makes our live become too much to manage. As a rule of thumb, a simple life always lead to happiness.</p>

<strong>4. Revisiting your core and foundation or Finding a new one</strong>

<p>If you are feeling lost then there know what it is like to not be lost. Revisiting your life at the time when you feel sure of life. Rexamine why it was so could help you get back on track.</p>

<p>For me it is Buddhism.</p>

<strong>5. Revisiting your core and foundation</strong>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>


 life become a whirlwind. We are 

The universality of what a good life is.
