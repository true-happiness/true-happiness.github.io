There will be times when life becomes too overwhelming. There will be times in our lives where we have no idea how go on with our lives. There will be times where doubt, fear, confusion, and uncertainty will set in and cloud our minds. In this age of information where we are constantly bombarded by the tales of what we should want in life. "You have to get a degree from college in order to be happy." "You need a new phone in order to look good in front of your friends." "You need that job/promotion." "You have to have that big house to be 'successful'." "You need to get married by this age or else it will be impossible afterward." On and on and on we are fed by stories of what tell us would bring happiness which often times does not but instead left us with a sense inadequancy to life.

So what should one do when life is at a loss? Here are four simple steps to getting back on your life..

<h2>4 Steps to Get Your Life Back</h2>
<strong>1. Stop</strong>

<blockquote>One evening I return to my hermitage from a walk in the hills, and I found that all the doors and windows of the hermitage had been blown open. When I left the house, I hadn't secured them, and a cold wind blew through the house, opened the windows, and scattered the papers from the desk all over the room. Immediately I closed the doors and the windows, lit a lamp, picked up the papers, and arranged them neatly on my desk. Then I started a fire in the fireplace, and soon the crackiling logs brought warmth back to the room.<br><br>-Thich Nhat Hanh</blockquote>

This is exactly what we do with our life when it is at a lost. Thich Nhat Hanh equates our senses as the doors and windows of our life. You can't pick yourself up in the middle of the storm. Sometimes it is wise to just stop from it all just to reorganise your life.

The purpose of this stop is not to give up. Its purpose is to recover and prepare to face life again.

Above is what Thich Nhat Hanh, one of the world most famous Zen master, wrote in his book "Present Moment Wonderful Moment." He equates the doors and windows as what we let into our live through our senses. 

What it implies is the fact that when life becomes too overwhelming

once depicted in a imagery of life as a small hut in a tonado. What do you do when the storm is here? You shut the windows and doors of your hut. This is exactly the same. We stop whatever 

The point of shutting is not to run away. It is not to hide. The point is to prepare and strength oneself. the point is to give oneself a place to start anew. If the storm is hitting your hut there is no way you will be able to manage anything in life.

<strong>2. Understand that it's ok to be lost.</strong>

<strong>3. Find your core and foundation</strong>

<p>If you are feeling lost then there know what it is like to not be lost. Revisiting your life at the time when you feel sure of life. Rexamine why it was so could help you get back on track.</p>

<p>For me it is Buddhism.</p>


<strong>4. Slowly begin anew</strong>

<p>The reason why we are sometimes confused with life is because we have too many wants which some are even conflicting with one another.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Simplify</strong>

<p>Having too much wants makes our live become too much to manage. As a rule of thumb, a simple life always lead to happiness.</p>
