<p>
	One of the worst fear of our life is that we become meaningless. Whether this would be meaningless to oneself, meaningless to others, or meaningless to the world. Useless or powerless has its root in the feeling of meaninglessness. 

	Many people hates feeling useless in life especially in this age where everything is about productivity.  

	But is being meaningful or useful in life
</p>

<p>
	But we are born meaningless. We have nothing to begin with. Why are we crying over something which is even already even better than when we are born. Many infants today die even before they get a chance to live. Why are we crying over our the bad luck despite being so lucky to live up until now?
</p>

<p>
	Happiness is, therefore, relative. Let's say you feel you are not rich enough. And you are unhappy about it. 
</p>

<p>We are so fearful that we will not have any meaning that we live our lives trying to add meaning to ourselves. We buy things we do not need to help boost our ego. We keep extending our identity to external things in life like a big home, a expensive car and etcs. </p>

<p>There is no meaning to all these. We are born with nothing and we will die with nothing. So what's the big deal?</p>


<p>We are as meaningless as we want to be. It all depends on what do you compare yourself with.</p>

<p>Life in essense is incomparable. </p>
