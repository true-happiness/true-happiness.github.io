last forever. that is true today will be true tomorrow.

Sorry if this website read like a textbook.

I am not trying to prove myself anything. I am not trying to be cool. I am not trying to gain popularity or build a reputation. I am not trying to sound sophisicated just to look "smart." I am not trying to be poetic to appeal anyone's sense of aesthetism.  I am not trying to be an elitist. I do not claim to know everything to life. What I simply want to offer you how to truly be happy. That's all. I write only what I believe will be enough for you to be happy.
