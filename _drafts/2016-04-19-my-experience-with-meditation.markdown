<p>It is not wrong to be curious about meditation and where it would take us. So as a long-time practitioner of mindfulness, here is a short list of what I have received/gained in these last 10 years of meditation.</p>

<h2>Happiness</h2>

<blockquote>Make a man happy and he will be happy for a day. Teach a man how to be happy and he will be happy for a life time.</blockquote>

People today are finding life more difficult to be happy and easier to be discontent. The reason is because our happiness is both fleeting and is always in front of us. We often think, "I'll be happy if...", "I'll be happy when..." But never is our happiness with us in this very moment. We have become so out of touch with our happiness that we barely know what happiness actually is. This is why we have become so busy running and jumping from one kind of happiness to the next hoping it would finally fulfil our lives. But the chase never ends. 

Meditation is a method which allows us to be in touch with our inner balance. It is not about chasing, but about coming home. Whenever our hearts are off-balanced by whatever life throws at us, we know. When we've regularly been practice mindfulness we are in touch with our inner balance. And for that reason, we can quickly discern our imbalances within our hearts. That is awareness.

What I mean by "imbalance" is our unhappiness; namely anger, worry, jealousy, greed, frustration, despair, disappointment and etcs. (For more information about what unhappiness is, click <a href="/principles_of_happiness/what_is_happiness/">here</a>.) 

When we are unawared of the unhappiness in our lives, the unhappiness spreads in our mind like wildfire. When you are angry at someone and you do not forgive him or her, what you eventually find is yourself saying bad things about him or her in your head. You will start convincing yourself how he or she is a bad person and how you will never talk to them again. So by allowing of inner fire to go wild, we unknowingly fueled our fire of hatred.

Noticing these imbalances quickly and objectively is enough for the fire to stop. When you practice long enough, you will notice, in split second, even the slightest imbalance in our hearts. When we could quickly see what is causing our unhappiness, we couldn't help but ask ourselves, "Why hold on to the hot iron?" This is precisely the reason why meditation or mindfulness is imperative to our happiness. 

Mindfulness protects our happiness. It allows us to see the true cause of our unhappiness. It helps us to not be comsumed by our own feelings and instead see it for what it is. Through mindfullness, we become the observer of our unhappiness and not the unhappiness itself. 

<!-- <blockquote>Hatred can't be stop by hatred. It only stops by compassion. <br>-Buddha</blockquote>

I can't tell you how many times a day these imbalances pop up in my daily life. And every single day for the last 10 years, mindfulness has countlessly saved my happiness. This is why I started True Happiness. This is why I know for sure that it will save your happiness too.

<h2>Self-Transformation</h2>

I used to think I am already "good". Even when others gave me honest constructive criticisms or useful feedbacks, I would see them as "attacks" or attempts to delegitimize my identity of being "good". I prefered to hold on to my image of "good" rather be good. And for that, I can't grow.

This attitude of being too good for improvement is perhaps the worst attitude anyone could have toward self-growth. According to the Buddha, he considered these people to already be "dead." For they no longer have anything more to offer because their attempts to hold on to their "goodness" has hinder them of bettering themselves.

Meditation has turn this attitude of mine 360 degrees. What meditation allows one to see is myself for who I really am. Before I was biased toward myself. I thought I was already "good" enough. But once I started seeing myself more and more, I start to see that I was not. I have found many contradictories within myself which I only applies to others but never to myself. I realised my prejudices, and double-standards which many times have causes me many troubles. I have come to see my many flaws and shortcomings which I had always overlook and sometimes even blame others for. I have overcame many unwholesome desires which I thought was my "happiness" but turns out just to be an attempt to fill the unfillable void in my heart. The list goes on and on.

The mind is like a garden. If you do not tend it, only weed grows. It is impossible to improve what we do not know because you don't even know what the thing to be improved is in the first place. This is precisely what meditation allows us to do: seeing ourselves. And if meditation could completely change who I am for the better then it will change yours too.

<h2>Love</h2>

This is not the romantic kind of "love" we know. But this is the love that is found and given out of self-understanding and selflessness. It is the love which comes as the fruits of meditation.

No one is perfect; and I am of no exception. Many times in my life I wanted to yell and insult others who have anger me. Many times in my life I feel jealous of others who are doing better than me. Many times in my life I wanted to hurt others who have hurt me. Many times in my life what wanted to lie and cheat to get whatever I want in life. But somehow I never did any of those things. 

Why? Because I was mindful of these unwholesome desires. And as a result, I was able to see my unwholesome desire for what it is. It's not me it is something which comes and goes, something which we do not have control over but we can choose, if we are mindful enough, not to be give in to it. This for me is love.

By coming to terms with my unwholesome desires, I give up my selfishness to find true peace and happiness. Each time I have overcome one unwholesome desire, I become better and better at understanding and overcoming myself. It's an upward spiral for one to be better oneself. And when I can overcoming these unwholesome desires, others are not effected by them.

This is love which is good for all, a win win situation.

<h2>Purpose in Life</h2>

Every individual lives to seek happiness in one form or another. However, the pursue of one's happiness does not necessarily mean that it is always beneficial for all. Often time than not, our pursues of happiness only benefit ourselves. And worse, in some cases, they come at the cost of others.

What is the best way of living life one that is beneficial for both oneself and the world? What is the best way to solve world problem and social problem of today? What is the best step to take toward creating the condition for world peace? <strong>What is the best thing life can offer?</strong> These are the questions I have since 18. 

In my journey to answer these questions, I began studying Philosophy. I traveled, backpacked, and lived in India, France, Japan and many others countries around the world. I ordained as a Theravada Buddhist monk for one full year to experience the simplicity of happiness and explore what is life all about.

After six years of ceaselessly searching for the answer, the answer I have found is happiness. Happiness is what create our world, for good or for evil. It dictates people lives and decides how our world will be. Wealth will not save this world from itself. Even if it rains in gold today, people's greed will not end. <strong>World peace can not be achieved by changing what is outside of us, it is achieved by developing how each and everyone of us seek and define happiness inside of ourselves.</strong>

Meditation is what is use for us to develop our happiness. Not only will we find both Truth and True Happiness, but through the practice of mindfulness it will also benefit this world as a whole. This is the best thing that one can do for oneself as well as the world.

<h2>Truth</h2>

<blockquote>"Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom." - Aristotle</blockquote>

What originally led me to meditation is not my desire to be happy, but rather my desire to know Truth. It is rather odd how the two coincide. But from my experience, they do and they must. There is no True Happiness without Truth. One would not be wrong to say that finding Truth is also finding True Happiness. 

During my time in college, I studied Philosophy. My journey in Philosophy has led to me know Truth. I know that Truth is outside of language. I know that it is the unspeakable. I know that it transcends all dualities of life. But what I am saying to you right now is like describing to you how a dish would taste. I could tell you all about it but in the end it is you who have to taste it to know what it actually taste like. Similarly, Truth can be learned. But it must be experienced through meditation in order to know what it actually is. 

Learning the Truth of Life is enjoyable in and of itself. Think of it as learning how to ride a horse. When you don't know how, it is difficult and stressful to try to steer it. But once you come to learn about the nature of the horse and how to ride it, it is much easier and much more enjoyable. Life is very much the same. The more I became aware of the Truth of life the easier and happier it becomes. 


Speaking from what I know, you either live life or the life will live you, one way or the other. And the only difference is whether or not we know life. Knowing life is precisely what meditation is for.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

What meditation has given me is unrequitable and invaluable. 

But even though I have spoken to you about what I have received through meditation, but just as a final note, <strong>meditation is not something anyone should expect to gain anything out of.</strong> The expectation and desire of meditation will make it impossible to succeed in any attempt to meditate. Even though meditation leads you to True Happiness, but you can't even expect or demand it to make you be happy. Meditation is just to be mindful of ourselves. Just that is enought to get us to True Happiness.

All in all, I am not here to prove to you why you should meditate. <strong>Meditation does not need convincing as much as it needs be proven.</strong> Thus, the only way to find out if what I have told you is true or if this will really give you True Happiness is to give it a try. Let meditation speaks its own truth to you so that you can see for yourself what meditation is and what it is for.
