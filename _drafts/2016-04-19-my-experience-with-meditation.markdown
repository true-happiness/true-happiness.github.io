<p>It is not wrong to be curious about meditation and where it would take us. So as someone who has practice mindfulness for more than 10 years, here is a short list of what I have recieved/gained through 10 years of meditation.</p>

<strong>Happiness</strong>

<blockquote>Make a man happy and he will be happy for a day. Teach a man how to to be happy and he will be happy for a life time.</blockquote>

People today are finding life more difficult to be happy and easier to be discontent. We are always looking for more. Our happiness is never with us but is always in front of us. We have become so out of touch with our happiness that we barely know what happiness actually is. We have become too busy running and jumping from one kind of happiness to the next hoping it would finally fulfil our lives. But the chase never ends. 

Meditation is not about chasing, but it is about coming home. What we seek is our inner balance. Meditation is a method which allow us to be in touch with our inner balance. Whenever our heart is off balance by whatever life throws at us, we know. When we are balanced, we are capable of quickly discerning our imbalances within our heart. And that is awareness.

When we are unawared of the unhappiness in our lives, the unhappiness spreads in us like wildfire. When you are angry at someone and you do not forgive him or her, what you eventually find is yourself saying bad things about him or her in your head. You will start convincing yourself how he or she is a bad person and how you will never talk to them again. So by allowing of inner fire to go wild, we unknowingly fueled our fire of hatred.

But when we could quickly realise what is causing our inner fire, we could helpt buy ask why hold on to the hot iron?  

<blockquote>Hatred can't be stop by hatred. It only stops by compassion. <br>-Buddha</blockquote>

The quicker we realise what is making us unhappy, the quicker it is for us to deal with it. This is precisely the reason why meditation or mindfulness is imperative to our happiness. The quicker you can spot the fire that burns us the quick it is for it to die down. 

When you practice long enough, you will notice, in split second, even the slightest imbalance in our heart. What I mean by imbalance is basically our unhappiness; namely anger, worry, jealousy, greed, frustration, despair, disappointment and etcs. (For more information about what unhappines is, click <a href="/principles_of_happiness/what_is_happiness/">here</a>.) Noticing these imbalances quickly and objectively is enough for the fire to stop. By being mindful of it, we become just the observer of our unhappiness and not the unhappiness itself. In this way, our mindfulness allows us to not be comsumed by our feelings.

I am lucky to have meditation and mindfulness in my life. I can't say how many times a day these imbalances pop up in my daily lives. And that is how many times meditation have saved my happiness. And surely, it will save yours too.

<strong>Self-Transformation</strong>

Human must and can be trained. And the best way for us to improve ourself is not to wait for others to tell us what we need to improve but to become our own teacher. But it is impossible to improve what we do not know. This is precisely where the practice of mindfulness or meditaiton comes in.

When you start looking inward you will no longer feel like you are already good. You will start seeing ways in which you could be better. You will start to see your weakness and short-comings where before you thought you were perfect. 

The worst attitude toward life is when we think we are already good enough. Too good for self-improvement is a mental wall which hinder us toward growth. In Thailand, we considered these kind of people "dead" because there is no growth. So know ourselves. And be objective when we look at ourselves.

Before I used to be a person who have an inferiority complex. I always feel the need to show off and boast to others as soon as I meet someone. I have never notice it until I started to meditate. What I realized is that I actually enjoy showing off to others. It was my "happiness." But as I practice more and more what I have come to see is that life has become exhausting. Why do I have prove myself or anyone how good I am in every context? Why can't I stand when others are better than me? 

I was holding on to hot iron that is why. And that hot iron is my pride to be better than others and my fear for others to be better than me. When I come to see it for what it is through the practice of mindfulness, I realize this was not healthy for me or anyone around me. Thus, I stop. 

This is just one of the many unwholesome desires which I have overcame. What I have realise is that not only have I become happier but I have also become a better person thought meditation. 

And if I could change, you could do it too!

<strong>Love</strong>

I am not perfect. 

Many times in my life I want to yell and insult others who has anger me.

Many times in my life I feel jealous of others who are doing better than me.

Many times in my life I want to hurt others who have hurt me.

But every time I was mindful of my unhappiness. I let it be without personalising it or denying it. And soon enough it passes away. For me this is love.

It is to  

I want to do all these things which I did not. 

No one is perfect. I must admit that sometimes I even have the worst thought in my mind. When I see my friend is doing something better than me. I want to destroy him. 

It has protected myself from harming others. I have better self-control though mindfulness.


It has protect myself from myself. I have better self-control though mindfulness.


It has given my life purpose.I have found my purpose in life through meditation


<strong>Purpose in life</strong>


Since I know my way around in the nature of myself I could help others as well.


<strong>Truth</strong>

<blockquote>"Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom." - Aristotle
</blockquote>

I have come to understand the truth of life.





What meditation has given me is unrequitable and invaluable. 

Even though I have spoken to you about what I have gain/recieved through meditation, but just as a final note, <strong>meditation is not something anyone should expect to gain anything out of.</strong> The expectation and desire will make it impossible to succeed in our attempt to meditate. You can't even expect or demand it to make you be happy. Meditation is just about being with ourselves and being mindful of ourselves. So just be careful and meditate for meditation's sake. That's how you will find True Happiness.

Beside from the my main list above, calmness, productivity, focus, are the byproduct of meditation. Meditation is the exercise for the mind.

So why do we meditate? 



Now that we understand why we meditate, the next article we will discuss about "How to Meditate?" so that you will know exactly what to do and what not to do. How can you practice.

<h2>How does meditation leads one to True Happiness?</h2>

<p>How could we be unhappy if we know everything is impermanent? How could we be unhappy if we know everything will not last forever? How could we be unhappy if we know reality is not about what we want but about the absolute law of cause and effect that determined it? </p>


<p>Meditation allows us to experience a state of stillness. Our mind is not looking for something it wants more. It is not concern about what is troubled what it is does not like. When the mind comes to know this state more and more it comes to experience what true happiness is.</p>

<p>But be careful that the practice of mindfulness is not about not thinking or ignoring or denying the reality of our undesirable thoughts. Mindfulness is simply to be mindful of everything. All thoughts, feelings and everything that come to our senses are <em>allowed.</em> The practice of mindfulness is not a judgement on ourselves or the world. It is not a self-management in which you have to assert control over ourselves. It is simply to be mindful of it.</p>

<p>The more we come to know ourselves for what it is the more we will realise the three noble truth which is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Everything is impermanent--ourselves, our feelings, our attitude, our body.</li>

<li>Nothing lasted.</li>

<li>Reality has nothing to do with what we want.</li>
</ol>

<p>True Happiness is not a path of control. It is a path of acceptance. </p>

<p>How could we be unhappy if we know everything is impermanent? How could we be unhappy if we know everything will not last forever? How could we be unhappy if reality is not about what we want but about the absolute law of cause and effect that determined reality? </p>

<p>We can't. But this is not a know that we can convince our heart and mind to accept. Through our mindfulness, we will let our heart and mind to see these truth for itself. We can say that we know everything is impermanent. But does our heart truly understand that?</p>

<p>There is a huge different between knowing intellectually andk nowing from the heart. </p>

This is probably one of the most unanswered question in meditation. Most people will be satified with the answer that meditation helps you calm your mind or it will increase your productivity. But is that really the reason why? I believe the reasons why there aren't many good explanation is because people do not know why.
