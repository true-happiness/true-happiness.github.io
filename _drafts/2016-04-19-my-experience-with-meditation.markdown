<p>Some of you might be curious as to why we pratice meditation and what would we gain from it. As someone who has practice mindfulness for more than 10 years, what I have recieved/gained from meditation is invaluable.</p>

<strong>Happiness</strong>

<blockquote>Make a man happy and he will be happy for a day. Teach a man how to to be happy and he will be happy for a life time.</blockquote>

People today are finding life more and more difficult to be happy and easier to be discontent with life. We are always looking for more. The happiness is always in front of us. We have become so out of touch with our happiness that we barely know what happiness actually is. We are too busy running and jumping from one kind of happiness to the next hoping it would finally fulfil our lives. But the chase never ends. 

Meditation is not about chasing, but it is about coming home. What we seek is our inner balance. Meditation keeps you close to that inner balance. This is why meditation allow us to find happiness easier in our daily lives. Whenever our heart is off balance by whatever life throws at us, we know. We quickly become aware of our imbalance within our heart.

When we are unawared of the unhappiness in our lives, the unhappiness spreads in us like wildfire. When you are angry at someone, if you do not forgive him or her what you eventually find is yourself saying bad things about him or her in your head. You will start to convince yourself how he or she is a bad person and how you will never talk to them again. So by allowing of inner fire to go wild, unknowingly fueled our hatred.

But why hold on to the hot iron?  

<blockquote>Hatred can't be stop by hatred. It only stops by compassion. <br>-Buddha</blockquote>

The quicker you realise what is making your unhappy, the quicker it is for you to deal with it. This is precisely the reason why meditation or mindfulness is imperative to our happiness. The quicker you can spot the fire that burns us the quick it is for it to die down. 

When you practice long enough, you will notice in split second even the slightest imbalance in our heart. What I mean by imbalance is basically unhappiness; namely anger, worry, jealousy, greed, frustration, despair, disappointment and etcs. (For more information about what unhappines is, click <a href="/principles_of_happiness/what_is_happiness/">here</a>.) Noticing these imbalances quickly and objectively is enough for the fire to stop. By being mindful of it, you know not to let your desire consume your life.

I am lucky to have meditation and mindfulness in my life. I can't say how many times a day these imbalances pop up in my daily lives. And that is how many times meditation have saved my happiness. And surely, it will save yours too.

<strong>Self-Transformation</strong>

It has completely transformed who I am. It has transformed my life for the better (example) I have become a better person

My attitude change .. now I want to improve myself. I want to learn about myself in order to be better for others.

<strong>Love</strong>

When 

No one is perfect. I must admit that sometimes I even have the worst thought in my mind. When I see my friend is doing something better than me. I want to destroy him. 

It has protected myself from harming others. I have better self-control though mindfulness.


It has protect myself from myself. I have better self-control though mindfulness.


It has given my life purpose.I have found my purpose in life through meditation


<strong>Purpose in life</strong>


Since I know my way around in the nature of myself I could help others as well.


<strong>Truth</strong>

<blockquote>"Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom." - Aristotle
</blockquote>

I have come to understand the truth of life.

 
Even though I have spoken to you about what I have gain/recieved through meditation, but just as a final note, <strong>meditation is not something anyone should expect to gain anything out of.</strong> The expectation and desire will make it impossible to succeed in our attempt to meditate. You can't even expect or demand it to make you be happy. Meditation is just about being with ourselves and being mindful of ourselves. So just be careful and meditate for meditation's sake. That's how you will find True Happiness.

Beside from the my main list above, calmness, productivity, focus, are the byproduct of meditation. Meditation is the exercise for the mind.

So why do we meditate? 



Now that we understand why we meditate, the next article we will discuss about "How to Meditate?" so that you will know exactly what to do and what not to do. How can you practice.

<h2>How does meditation leads one to True Happiness?</h2>

<p>How could we be unhappy if we know everything is impermanent? How could we be unhappy if we know everything will not last forever? How could we be unhappy if we know reality is not about what we want but about the absolute law of cause and effect that determined it? </p>


<p>Meditation allows us to experience a state of stillness. Our mind is not looking for something it wants more. It is not concern about what is troubled what it is does not like. When the mind comes to know this state more and more it comes to experience what true happiness is.</p>

<p>But be careful that the practice of mindfulness is not about not thinking or ignoring or denying the reality of our undesirable thoughts. Mindfulness is simply to be mindful of everything. All thoughts, feelings and everything that come to our senses are <em>allowed.</em> The practice of mindfulness is not a judgement on ourselves or the world. It is not a self-management in which you have to assert control over ourselves. It is simply to be mindful of it.</p>

<p>The more we come to know ourselves for what it is the more we will realise the three noble truth which is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Everything is impermanent--ourselves, our feelings, our attitude, our body.</li>

<li>Nothing lasted.</li>

<li>Reality has nothing to do with what we want.</li>
</ol>

<p>True Happiness is not a path of control. It is a path of acceptance. </p>

<p>How could we be unhappy if we know everything is impermanent? How could we be unhappy if we know everything will not last forever? How could we be unhappy if reality is not about what we want but about the absolute law of cause and effect that determined reality? </p>

<p>We can't. But this is not a know that we can convince our heart and mind to accept. Through our mindfulness, we will let our heart and mind to see these truth for itself. We can say that we know everything is impermanent. But does our heart truly understand that?</p>

<p>There is a huge different between knowing intellectually andk nowing from the heart. </p>

This is probably one of the most unanswered question in meditation. Most people will be satified with the answer that meditation helps you calm your mind or it will increase your productivity. But is that really the reason why? I believe the reasons why there aren't many good explanation is because people do not know why.
