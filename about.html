<!-- <h2 class="section-heading">Why True Happiness?</h2> -->

<!-- <p>In the world where success has become more important than happiness, it is only natural that we, human, have become unhappy. Knowing that there is a better way out of this social trap, I would like to share my passion of learning to be happiness with you so that you can contin</p> -->


<h2 class="section-heading">Story</h2>

<p>My name is Supakorn Laohasongkram. I was born in Bangkok, Thailand. I am <span id="my_age"></span> years old. Learning about how to become a better and happier person is my passion. Ever since college, I have always want to know is what life is all about, how to rightly live, and what is the solution for making the world a better place. I've graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with degree in the Master of Applied Positive Psychology.</p>

<!-- <p>And so, I have taken a leap of faith and decided to dedicate my life to this goal by starting this blog despite the fact that I am running on negative income. My friends said I am crazy because I can't survive if no one knows who I am. My dad shakes his head and said "It's not possible" because no one will want to listen to someone without a formal qualifaction. My mother's advice seems to be more focused on how to first become famous and well-known rather than focusing on what to me matter most: <strong>helping others</strong>. I have faith that what I do here is truly good. And I believe that as long as my focus and desire is first and foremost to help others, the readers will truly benefit. Everything else will then fall into its place to make my immediate goal of making a living doing what I love a reality. So please help support me, see what I have to offer, and join me in the journey toward true happiness.</p> -->

<h2 class="section-heading">Commitment</h2>

<p>Happiness is important to each one of us. But it also has a crucial role in defining our society. If happiness is to "take" rather than to "give" then there is no question why there is a huge disparity, inequality, and injustice in this world. Thus, happiness  can and must be developed. So that not only will we be happier in our lives but at the same time make this world into a better place.</p>

<p>Over <span id="year_of_practice"></span> years of practice, I realize how valuable and transformative it is for one to be able to learn about happiness. I have no desire for money, fame or to prove any point. I simply know how to help and want to help. Thus, my commitment is to your happiness. My goal is to help everyone achieve True Happiness. Whether you are seeking for a greater happiness in life or in need of a helping hand. My promise is to be there to support you. This is the <strong>work I cannot not do</strong>. So do not hesitate to <a href="/contact">contact me!</a></p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Goal</h2>

<p>My goal for this website is to offer you truth. I am not telling you to believe me. In fact, I am telling you to <em>not</em> believe me. Why? Because what I am giving you is merely the path. But you have to walk it so that you could <strong>see for yourself</strong> if what I say is true and whether or not it actually helps and transforms your happiness and everything around you. That is all.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Approach</h2>

<p>We learn True Happiness like we learn how to swim. The way to truth for True Happiness is not dialogic or is it a quantitative analysis. We do not learn how to swim by debating or arguing about it nor do we take a step outside of our swimming to measure or analyse to learn how to swim.  The only way to learn happiness is put the practice of True Happiness to work and see for yourself its truth.</p>
