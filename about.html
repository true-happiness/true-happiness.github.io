<p>My passion is to learn how to be happy and a long the way help others to be happy. I have taken a leap of faith and decided to dedicate my life to this goal by starting this blog even though I am running on negative income. My friends said I am crazy because I can't survive if no one knows who I am. My dad shakes his head and said "It's not possible" because no one will want to listen to someone without a formal qualifaction. My mother's advice seems to be more focused on how to first become famous and well-known rather than focusing on what to me matter most: <strong>helping others</strong>. I have faith in my "goodness." And I believe that as long as my focus and desire is first and foremost to help others, the readers will truly benefit. Everything else will then fall into its place to make my immediate goal of making a living doing what I love a reality. I believe that my "goodness" will prevail and strive under all conditions and I hope everybody too believe in their own "goodness." So please help support me and take your time to see what I have to offer!</p>

<p>As for the formal biography, I was born in Bangkok, Thailand. As I write this, I am 27 years old. I graduated from Earlham College in 2010. Since college, all I wanted to know is what life is all about, how to rightly live, and what is the solution for making the world a better place. I have started by learning philosophy and after college I ordained as a Buddhist monk for one year at <a href="http://www.suanmokkh.org/">Suan Mokkh</a> and <a href="http://www.pasukato.org/">Wat Pasukato</a>. Through these experiences, I found happiness to be the solution. It's the solution which if solved within will also solved the world outside. It's a complete solution for one's happiness as well as everyone in this world.

Finding happiness and telling others this kind of happiness then has become my purpose. It's the work I cannot not do. This is why I have started this blog in hope that you too will join me to make ourselves happier and make this world happier as well.</p>


<!-- <p>If one's happiness is rather to "give" rather than "take" then


I completely fell in love with Buddhism and how its definition of happiness. Because what I found out is out one defines "happiness" is not only crucial for one's happiness but also crucial to how thx
Of course, I am not saying Buddhism is right, but rather I want everyone to try it and experience for yourself what This might sounds like a religion but I'll tell you it's not. It's just a way of life which is practical in daily life and </p> -->
