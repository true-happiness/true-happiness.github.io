<!-- <h2 class="section-heading">Why True Happiness?</h2> -->

<!-- <p>In the world where success has become more important than happiness, it is only natural that we, human, have become unhappy. Knowing that there is a better way out of this social trap, I would like to share my passion of learning to be happiness with you so that you can contin</p> -->


<h2 class="section-heading">My Story</h2>

<p>My name is Supakorn Laohasongkram. I was born in Bangkok, Thailand. I am <span id="my_age"></span> years old. Learning about how to become a better and happier person is my passion. Ever since college, I have always want to know is what life is all about, how to rightly live, and what is the solution for making the world a better place.</p>

<p>In my search to answer these questions in life, I began studying Philosophy. I traveled, backpacked, and lived in India, France, Japan and many other countries around the world. After college, I even ordained as a Theravada Buddhist monk for one full year to experience the simplicity of happiness and explore what is life all about.</p>

<p>Six years after ceaselessly searching, I have finally found the answer which satisfied my questions to life. And the answer is happiness.</p>

<p>Happiness is important to each one of us. But it is also has a crucial in its role in defining our society. If happiness is to "take" rather than to "give" then there is no question why there is a huge disparity, inequality, and injustice in this world. Thus, happiness must can can be developed. So that not only will we be happier in our lives but at the same time make this world a better place.</p>

<!-- <p>And so, I have taken a leap of faith and decided to dedicate my life to this goal by starting this blog despite the fact that I am running on negative income. My friends said I am crazy because I can't survive if no one knows who I am. My dad shakes his head and said "It's not possible" because no one will want to listen to someone without a formal qualifaction. My mother's advice seems to be more focused on how to first become famous and well-known rather than focusing on what to me matter most: <strong>helping others</strong>. I have faith that what I do here is truly good. And I believe that as long as my focus and desire is first and foremost to help others, the readers will truly benefit. Everything else will then fall into its place to make my immediate goal of making a living doing what I love a reality. So please help support me, see what I have to offer, and join me in the journey toward true happiness.</p> -->
