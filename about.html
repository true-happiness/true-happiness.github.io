<h2 class="section-heading">My Story</h2>

<p>Hi, my name is Supakorn Laohasongkram. I was born in Bangkok, Thailand. As I write this, I am 27 years old. I graduated from Earlham College in 2010. Ever since college, all I wanted to know is what life is all about, how to rightly live, and what is the solution for making the world a better place. During my time in college, I learned philosophy. After college I ordained as a Buddhist monk for one year at <a href="http://www.suanmokkh.org/">Suan Mokkh</a> and <a href="http://www.pasukato.org/">Wat Pasukato</a>. Six years after I first question life, I have finally found the solution which satisfied it. The solution is rather quite simple; it's happiness.</p>

<p>To solve social or world problem begin with the individual who comprises of it. And more importantly, <strong>how each of those individual seek and define happiness</strong>. If happiness is to "take" rather than to "give" then there is no question why there is a huge disparity, inequality, and injustice in this world. This is why my passion is to learn how to be happy and along the way help others to find true happiness one which is wholesome and beneficial to all. This is the <strong>work I cannot not do</strong>.

<!-- <p>And so, I have taken a leap of faith and decided to dedicate my life to this goal by starting this blog despite the fact that I am running on negative income. My friends said I am crazy because I can't survive if no one knows who I am. My dad shakes his head and said "It's not possible" because no one will want to listen to someone without a formal qualifaction. My mother's advice seems to be more focused on how to first become famous and well-known rather than focusing on what to me matter most: <strong>helping others</strong>. I have faith that what I do here is truly good. And I believe that as long as my focus and desire is first and foremost to help others, the readers will truly benefit. Everything else will then fall into its place to make my immediate goal of making a living doing what I love a reality. So please help support me, see what I have to offer, and join me in the journey toward true happiness.</p> -->
