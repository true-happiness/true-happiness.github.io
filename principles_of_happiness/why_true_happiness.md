What sets human apart of animal?


What is the best way save the world?

If people today seeks happiness by "taking" rather than "giving," would the world find peace if it rains in gold tomorrow? 

If people today seeks happiness by gaining more power for themselves rather than being better for others, would the world find peace in justice and equality tomorrow?

If people today seeks happiness only for their own rich without any regards for others or the environment, would the world find peace tomorrow if ?

If people today seeks happiness in "taking" rather than "giving", would we find justice and equality in our society even if the GDP of every countries increases a thousand folds tomorrow?

If people today seeks happiness in only finding their own rich regardless of others or the environment, would the world find peace 


If people today seeks happiness is 




Everybody in the whole can be rich, they can be healthy, they be equiped with all the best tools and technology, but world would still not find peace.




Is making everybody rich the answer? Is giving people more knowledge the answer? 

Even if everybody is rich today, would that be world peace? 

World peace is not possible as long as the individual who comprises it is not peaceful.

Learning about True Happiness is the only difference we have more being merely animals.

It's difficult to live with those who do not know true happiness. It's like living among animals.

True Happiness is the answer to all social problems which stems from human's greed and selfishness.

Two type of happiness with for self and one for others or selfishness and selflessness.

True Happiness is the key 

How would true happiness save the world?

The best world is not a world with the perfect law, but the world with perfect self-awareness. The best police in the wolrd is our mindfulness.


The world would be a difference place if everyone knows the different between happiness and True Happiness. Happiness, by the definition we've learn earlier <a href="/principles_of_happiness/what_is_happiness">here</a>, is a match between what we want from reality and what reality is. However, no where does the definition of happiness tells us what to want or what we should change the reality into. Its only requirement is for us to match our want and the reality in order to produce happiness. Thus, happiness could be attained in any ways imaginable from taking our kids our to dinner, sacrificing our lives for others, stealing billions of dollars, or getting a tattoo. For some, stealing from others could be a source of happiness. And for many, taking advantage of others is deemed as 'smart' and sometimes even a desirable ability to be aspired for.

The problem we have here is nicely summerised by one of the most famous scienctist of all time, Albert Einstein.

<blockquote>Confusion of goals and perfection of means seems, in my opinion, to characterize our age.<br>- Albert Einstein</blockquote>

What we, humans, have is "the perfection of means" to achieve whatever we could desire. Yet, the real question that we do not often asked is "what and how should we want?" When we have "the perfection of means" with the "confusion of goals" what we get is the world we are living in. A world full of social problems, full of people taking advantages of one another, a world of chaos. 





Most would be satisfied with whatever others want: money, fame, status, and power. But is that really true happiness? and where does those kind of outer riches got us today. 


When this question is answered to its fullest. When this question become "of no concerns" in the modern times where outer riches are almost al

in this age where outer riches is almost always more important. 


But what most of us do not question is what should we want in life?


Happiness could be for good or for evil, it all depends on what we want. 


Albert Einstein once said:











Most would be satisfied with just being happiness. We do not take our happiness seriously enough to know if our happiness.



This is the question not many asked in life. It seems as though what we want is already set: money, status, fame, family, good job, and etcs. No one teaches us if 


the question of what one should desire is often left out and neglected. We just want to be happy.


Happiness is not enough. The world is at its current stage because how we have been seeking happiness. 


what we are most confused about is what 

but do we ever question what we desire?

we are not critical about what we want

we are crude about what we should want in life we simply want whatever the world tells us we should want: money, status, fame ande etcs.

we do not know what, why, or how we should want. And we do not know what we want, others will tell us what to want. Of course, this ended up being money, status, or fame. Anything that we not make us feel lesser than our friends and neighbors. 


In the eyes of the modern man, whether or not these are ways of attaining true happiness is of no concerns as long as they could make us happy. Since there is no concerns to differentiate these ways of achieving happiness, there is also no concerns between what is good and bad. There is no difference between stealing from others and giving your life for others. There is no difference between killing and saving lives. As long as, they could give me happiness. Any means would be satisfactory.





True Happiness is scarce, neglected, and unappreciated in this age where outer riches is almost always more important. 



Happiness therefore could be attain in a way imaginable, wholesome or unwholesome, for good or for ill.

We, human, do not care enough about happiness. We are not even mindful of our own 


as long as, those action generate happiness for one. as long as those give me more money, status, and fame. The means does not matter. 




Since we do not care to learn about true happiness, we also do not care of if those

There is a world difference between happiness and true happiness. Anyone could pursue happiness. 



 All that we concern about is to be happy. Whether or not this we would doing good or bad, saving lives or killing others, stealing or sacrificing your life for others as long as we could get in the spotlight of being "successful". 



Since we do not care to carefully discern between what true happiness and what happiness is, anyone could do anything just to be happy. There is no different between doing what is good and bad. There is no difference between stealing from others and giving your life for others. There is no difference between killing and saving lives. as long as, those action generate happiness for one. as long as those give me more money, status, and fame. The means does not matter. 

If happiness 


Thus, the world is as so. 

Happiness is just happiness.

Since we do not care about happiness there is not much different for people 

 What matters more is what can be count, not what can't. 

Most would be satisfied with just being happy without digging into what true happiness really is. 


But whether or not these are true happiness is not something people care too much about today. It is just not matter of concern in the capitalistic society where what is important is measurable and quantifiable like GDP, grades, money and etcs. 



People commit crime because they

If one critically examines social problems across the history of mankind, what lies at the core of many of these problems is the central question of how each and every individual seeks and defines happiness. If happiness is to "take" rather than to "give" then there is no question why there is a huge disparity, inequality, and injustice in this world. 
We know too little our 

I have never heard a real  for most of us as long as we get to feel something. Thus, for those who do not look deeply enough inside themselves, there is no different between happiness and true happiness.



Despite the crucial role happiness has in world, we, humans, have tossed aside the most important thing in life.


 We know too little about what happiness is. But for some, 


People knows too little about how to find True Happiness. Most would be satisfied with what seeking just happiness. 
Thus, there is no different between doing what is good and bad. There is no difference between stealing from others and giving your life for others. There is no difference between kill and saving a life. Thus, the world is as so. 


 Imagine what would it be like if everyone in the world seeks happiness by looking for ways in which they could give to the world? Wouldn’t that instantly make the world a better place?







There is a world different between pursuing happiness and pursuing true happiness. Anyone could attain happiness. 

The reason why the world has all these issues in the world is because people do not know how to find true happiness. Most,

 It's the difference between finding joy in "taking" and "giving". It's the difference between



Only learning about true happiness will it save us from ourselves.

Only learning about true happiness will save the world of its own demise.

People are solving world problems not from its core.

It's good for you.

It's good for everyone around you.

It's good for the world.
