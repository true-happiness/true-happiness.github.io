<h2 class="section-heading">Welcome to True Happiness</h2>

<p>If you are looking for ways to be happier then you are in the right place. This website is my gift to you. Learning about how to become a better and happier person is my passion. What you will learn is not only how to be happy, but also how to improve your life and everything around you. I have no desire for money, fame or to prove any point. I simply know how to help and want to help. So please don't be afraid to talk to me personally and explore what I have to offer to enrich your life!</p>

<!-- <p>These are questions in life which I want to answer if today is my last day on Earth. I would die happy knowing I did what I have to to help others in the best way possible.</p> -->

<!-- <h2 class="section-heading">How to be happy?</h2> -->

<h2 class="section-heading">The Way to Happiness</h2>

<p>Happiness is a science. And the goal of this True Happiness is to turn you into a "happiness expert." The laboratory in which we will work at is ourselves. There are only four questions in which we need to be able to answer to have a grasp of how to attain true happiness in life...

<ul>
	<li><a href="/principles_of_happiness/what_is_happiness/">What is true happiness?</a></li>
	<li><a href="/principles_of_happiness/cause_of_happiness/">What are the causes and conditions of happiness?</a></li>
	<li><a href="/principles_of_happiness/how_of_happiness/">How to attain true happiness?</a></li>
	<li><a href="/principles_of_happiness/why_true_happiness/">Why true happiness matters?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>These are the four main questions in which this website will help you answer.</p>

<p>Depending on how you would like to approach this, you can first start off with laying down the right foundation of happiness or get right into the practice. Either way, you will need <em>both</em>--the right knowledge as well as the right practice--in order to achieve True Happiness, not one or the other.</p>

<!-- <h4>The Right Knowledge</h4>

<ul>
	<li>What is true happiness?</li>
	<li>What are the causes and conditions of happiness?</li>
	<li>How to attain true happiness?</li>
	<li>How and why is learning to be happy will not only make you happier but also make the world a better place.</li>
</ul>

<h4>The Right Practice</h4>

<p></p>

<ul>
	<p>Knowing Thyself: the Art of Mindfulness</p>
	<li>What's the point of practicing mindfulness?</li>
	<li>The complete guide to the practice of mindfulness in daily life</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Habit Building: Habits Build Success!</li>
	<li>Find a community/ Create an accountablility group</li>
	<li>Create your environment where your practice will thrive</li>
	<li></li>
</ul>


</p> -->


<!-- <p>Happiness requires work. You need to be an expert at it. You will need to put the theory into practice. Thus, the way to happiness is not one you can read about, but one you experience.</p> -->


<!-- <h2 class="section-heading">What is True Happiness?</h2>

<p>Happiness is when you get what you want. True Happiness when you are satisfied with what you have or in other words you have no more wants. Everything is perfect as is.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What are the causes and conditions of happiness?</h2>

<p>The cause of happiness is the absent of unhappiness. Unhappiness in this case is when what you want from life is not in harmony with what reality is or to put in a simpler term "life is not like what you want."</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">How to attain true happiness?</h2>

<p>Since true happiness is a state of being satisfied with life, one must learn how to be satisfied with what is.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">How to attain true happiness?</h2> -->





<!-- <h2 class="section-heading">The Shortest Version of “How to Be Happy"</h2>
<h2 class="section-heading">The Shortest Version of What This Website has to Offer</h2>

<p>To learn how to be happy is learn how to handle “unhappiness” in life. In reality, it is impossible to always get what you want. Thus, the happiness man alive can’t be someone who always get what he/she wants but instead is someone who has mastered how to handle “unhappiness” in life. Unhappiness in life is caused by dissonance between what you want from life and what is life is. If you are not rich and to want to be rich then you are unhappy. If you want a promotion, but you didn’t get your promotion then you are unhappy. If you want someone to live, but he or she dies then you are unhappy. So the shortest version of “how to be happy” is to learn how to learn how to live with reality, not with what you want from reality.</p>

<p>Another way to rephrase this is to learn how to find contentment in the present moment. If you can learn to be happy in the present moment then it’s no different than learning to be happy forever. Our inability to be satisfied with the now causes us to never be truly satisfied with life. We are always either chasing what we want in the future or what we had in the past. But never fulfilled in the here and now.</p>

<p>Thus, here are <strong>4 simple steps to get you started on this journey toward happiness</strong>:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Identify what’s making you unhappy.</li>
	<p>Usually this is where mindfulness and self-reflection comes into play. But for now a list would do.</p>
	<li>Learn to understand the nature of happiness and unhappiness.</li>
	<li>Learn how to response to “unhappiness” Work at it. See yourself improve. Tell people about it. Find friends who are also learning to be happy.</li>
	<li>Repeat.</li>
</ol> -->

<!-- <h2 class="section-heading">Can I really find True Happiness in this website?</h2>

<p>The answer is yes if you actually put them to use in your daily live. The way to Truth in this website is not what I tell you. The way to Truth in this website is for you to experiment what I tell you in your own live and experience it for yourself </p> -->
