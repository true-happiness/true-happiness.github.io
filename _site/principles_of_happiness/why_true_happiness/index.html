			<p>Would making the everyone in the world richer give us world peace?</p>

<p>We are so focused on generating incomes and raising GDP. But even if it rains in gold today, can we expect people to be happy and satisfied with what they have or can we expect a war where people would fight and kill one another for it.</p>

<!-- We believe in making the world better and more efficient through technology. But even if we all have the best and latest technology in our hands, would that give us world peace?
 -->
<p>We have poured billions of dollars into bettering our education system but does giving humans more power and skills without teaching them how to excecise that power lead us toward world peace? Or will we, once again, run in Theodore Roosevelt’s truism which he stated:</p>

<blockquote>A man who has never gone to school may steal from a freight car; but if he has a university education, he may steal the whole railroad."</blockquote>

<p>As long as people today still seeks happiness by “taking” rather than “giving”, there will be no peace in this world.</p>

<p>As long as people today still seeks happiness in being more power for themselves more than for the benefits of all, there will be no peace in this world.</p>

<p>As long as people today still seeks happiness only for their own riches without any regards for others or the environment, there will be no peace in this world.</p>

<p>As long as people today still seeks happiness in taking advantage of others, there will be no peace in the world.</p>

<h2>World Peace is Not Possible Without True Happiness.</h2>

<p>There is a world difference between what happiness and True Happiness is. <strong>Happiness is achieved by fulfilling our desire. True Happiness is achieved by overcoming it.</strong> True Happiness is about giving. Happiness is mostly about taking. True Happiness is not dependent on anything. Happiness is always depend on something. Happiness is relative happiness. True Happiness is absolute happiness. Happiness needs to be satisfied. True Happiness is the state of already being satisfied. Happiness is a chasing. True Happiness is that of a coming home.</p>

<p>The problem with happiness is that <strong>happiness could be attained in any ways imaginable</strong> from taking our kids to dinner, sacrificing our lives for others, stealing billions of dollars, or getting a tattoo. By <a href="/principles_of_happiness/what_is_happiness">definition</a>, happiness is a match between what we want from reality and what reality is. No where does the definition of happiness tells us what to want or what we should change the reality into. Its only requirement is for us is to match the reality with our want in order to produce happiness. This therefore leave us with a freedom to want anything.</p>

<p>Despite the nebulous nature of happiness, happiness could still be generalized into 3 main types.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Happiness for oneself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Happiness for others.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>True Happiness</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Happiness if not developed always resort to the lowest possible form which is to seek happiness only for oneself. This tendency to be selfish is innate and hardwired in our instinct. It is what living things do preserve itself and survive. This is precisely the reason why the world run by the law of “survival of the fittest”. This is why we are fighting and taking advantageous of one another. This is why the world in some sense could be cruel and heartless.</p>

<p>However, this does not mean that we can’t change it. In fact, there is one crucial factor which sets humans apart from mere animals. And that is our ability <strong>to know ourselves.</strong> Animals do not have such privilege. When a mosquito sees a blue light, its instinct tells it to fly toward it even though it might me a zapper. When the moth sees a flame, it has no choice but to instinctively fly toward the fire and its own death. Humans have similar instinct. When we see something we want, we want to take it. When we see a person we romantically interested we want to have him or her. Thus, what sets human apart is our <strong>ability to know and train our own instinct.</strong> This is why when we are attracted to someone we think twice before approaching someone. This is why even though we want something we do not steal.</p>

<p>This leads us to the main point of this article which is…</p>

<h2>Happiness Can and Must Be Developed</h2>

<p>We, humans, have put so much emphasis on building and improving what is outside of ourselves that we have neglected and forgotten how and why we should develop what is inside of ourselves. Happiness is what create our world, for good or for evil. It dictates people lives and decide how our world will be. Thus, happiness matters.</p>

<p>World peace can not be achieved by changing what is outside of us, it is achieved by developing how each and everyone of us seek and define happiness inside of ourselves. It requires us to develop happiness ever higher.</p>

<p>It is the task that is needed most in todays world where happiness for oneself rules over the happiness for others. It is the task endowed specifically to humans to better ourselves.</p>

<p>So not only will you find True Happiness to make you a happier person anywhere at any time, but it will also benefit this world as a whole. This is what this website is about.</p>

<p><strong>World Peace Begins Here.</strong></p>

We all seeks to be better and more power in order to be able to control the world. But does making everyone more educated powerful lead us toward world peace?

<h2>Learning to find True Happiness is the best and highest possible thing for human being.</h2>
<h2>Learning to find True Happiness is good for ourselves, it allows ourselves to transform, and also transform others and also save the world</h2>

<h2>Learning how to find True Happiness is therefore learning how to save the world.</h2>




Happiness Development is the goal of this website.

Level of Happiness

1. Self-Indulgent.

2. Selfless.


True Happiness is not for oneself.




Whatever is the case, what is important here is that happiness matters. It dictates people lives and decide how our world will be.


<h2>World peace is not possible without True Happiness.</h2>

There is a world difference between what happiness is and what True Happiness is. True Happiness is selfless. Its goal is to find peace and satisfaction from within. 






So what will save this world?


And when we don't look hard enough at what happiness really is. We, humans, become the victim of our own quest for happiness. The problem we have here is nicely summerised by one of the most famous scienctist of all time, Albert Einstein.

<blockquote>Confusion of goals and perfection of means seems, in my opinion, to characterize our age.<br>- Albert Einstein</blockquote>

What we, humans, have is "the perfection of means" to achieve whatever we could desire. Yet, we never really question ourselves about what to want in life. And when we don't look into what we should want in life, we ended up wanting whatever others want.



<hr>

Would the rich stop fighting with one another? If it rains tomorrow can we expect there to be no fighting among ourselves?

True Happiness is what set humans apart from being merely animals

True Happiness is the best way to save the world.

True Happiness is complete solution for life.

What sets human apart of animal?


What is the best way save the world?

If people today seeks happiness by "taking" rather than "giving," would the world find peace even if it rains in gold tomorrow? 

If people today seeks happiness by gaining more power for themselves rather than for the benefits of all, would the world find peace, justice and equality tomorrow?

If people today seeks happiness only for their own rich without any regards for others or the environment, would the world find peace tomorrow if ?

If people today seeks happiness in "taking" rather than "giving", would we find justice and equality in our society even if the GDP of every countries increases a thousand folds tomorrow?

If people today seeks happiness in only finding their own rich regardless of others or the environment, would the world find peace 


If people today seeks happiness is 

Everybody in the world can be rich, they can be healthy, they be equiped with all the best tools and technology, but world would still not find peace.

Is making everybody rich the answer? Is giving people more knowledge the answer? 

Even if everybody is rich today, would that be world peace? 

World peace is not possible as long as the individual who comprises it is not peaceful.

Learning about True Happiness is the only difference we have more being merely animals.

It's difficult to live with those who do not know true happiness. It's like living among animals.

Benefits of Dhamma

True Happiness is the best thing one could strive for in life. 

Seeking True Happiness is the answer to life.

True Happiness is the answer to all social problems which stems from human's greed and selfishness.

Two type of happiness with for self and one for others or selfishness and selflessness.

True Happiness is the key 

How would true happiness save the world?

The best world is not a world with the perfect law, but the world with perfect self-awareness. The best police in the wolrd is our mindfulness.


The world would be a difference place if everyone knows the different between happiness and True Happiness. 

Happiness, by the definition we've learn earlier <a href="/principles_of_happiness/what_is_happiness">here</a>, is a match between what we want from reality and what reality is. However, no where does the definition of happiness tells us what to want or what we should change the reality into. Its only requirement is for us to match our want and the reality in order to produce happiness. Thus, happiness could be attained in any ways imaginable from taking our kids our to dinner, sacrificing our lives for others, stealing billions of dollars, or getting a tattoo. For some, stealing from others could be a source of happiness. And for many, taking advantage of others is deemed as 'smart' and sometimes even a desirable ability to be aspired for.






Yet, the real question that we do not often asked is "what and how should we want?" When we have "the perfection of means" with the "confusion of goals" what we get is the world we are living in. A world full of social problems, full of people taking advantages of one another, a world of chaos. 





Most would be satisfied with whatever others want: money, fame, status, and power. But is that really true happiness? and where does those kind of outer riches got us today. 


When this question is answered to its fullest. When this question become "of no concerns" in the modern times where outer riches are almost al

in this age where outer riches is almost always more important. 


But what most of us do not question is what should we want in life?


Happiness could be for good or for evil, it all depends on what we want. 


Albert Einstein once said:











Most would be satisfied with just being happiness. We do not take our happiness seriously enough to know if our happiness.



This is the question not many asked in life. It seems as though what we want is already set: money, status, fame, family, good job, and etcs. No one teaches us if 


the question of what one should desire is often left out and neglected. We just want to be happy.


Happiness is not enough. The world is at its current stage because how we have been seeking happiness. 


what we are most confused about is what 

but do we ever question what we desire?

we are not critical about what we want

we are crude about what we should want in life we simply want whatever the world tells us we should want: money, status, fame ande etcs.

we do not know what, why, or how we should want. And we do not know what we want, others will tell us what to want. Of course, this ended up being money, status, or fame. Anything that we not make us feel lesser than our friends and neighbors. 


In the eyes of the modern man, whether or not these are ways of attaining true happiness is of no concerns as long as they could make us happy. Since there is no concerns to differentiate these ways of achieving happiness, there is also no concerns between what is good and bad. There is no difference between stealing from others and giving your life for others. There is no difference between killing and saving lives. As long as, they could give me happiness. Any means would be satisfactory.





True Happiness is scarce, neglected, and unappreciated in this age where outer riches is almost always more important. 



Happiness therefore could be attain in a way imaginable, wholesome or unwholesome, for good or for ill.

We, human, do not care enough about happiness. We are not even mindful of our own

Since we do not care to learn about true happiness, we also do not care of if those

There is a world difference between happiness and true happiness. Anyone could pursue happiness. 



 All that we concern about is to be happy. Whether or not this we would doing good or bad, saving lives or killing others, stealing or sacrificing your life for others as long as we could get in the spotlight of being "successful". 



Since we do not care to carefully discern between what true happiness and what happiness is, anyone could do anything just to be happy. There is no different between doing what is good and bad. There is no difference between stealing from others and giving your life for others. There is no difference between killing and saving lives. as long as, those action generate happiness for one. as long as those give me more money, status, and fame. The means does not matter.
