				<p>It is not wrong to be curious about meditation and where it would take us. So as a long-time practitioner of mindfulness, here is a short list of what I have received/gained in these last 10 years of meditation.</p>

<h2>Happiness</h2>

<blockquote>Make a man happy and he will be happy for a day. Teach a man how to be happy and he will be happy for a life time.</blockquote>

<p>People today are finding life more difficult to be happy and easier to be discontent. The reason is because our happiness is both fleeting and is always in front of us. We often think, “I’ll be happy if…”, “I’ll be happy when…” But never is our happiness with us in this very moment. We have become so out of touch with our happiness that we barely know what happiness actually is. This is why we have become so busy running and jumping from one kind of happiness to the next hoping it would finally fulfil our lives. But the chase never ends.</p>

<p>Meditation is a method which allow us to be in touch with our inner balance. It is not about chasing, but about coming home. Whenever our hearts are off-balanced by whatever life throws at us, we know because when if we’ve regularly been practice mindfulness we have become in touch with our inner balanced. And for that reason, we can quickly discern our imbalances within our hearts. That is awareness.</p>

<p>What I mean by “imbalance” is our unhappiness; namely anger, worry, jealousy, greed, frustration, despair, disappointment and etcs. (For more information about what unhappiness is, click <a href="/principles_of_happiness/what_is_happiness/">here</a>.)</p>

<p>When we are unawared of the unhappiness in our lives, the unhappiness spreads in our mind like wildfire. When you are angry at someone and you do not forgive him or her, what you eventually find is yourself saying bad things about him or her in your head. You will start convincing yourself how he or she is a bad person and how you will never talk to them again. So by allowing of inner fire to go wild, we unknowingly fueled our fire of hatred.</p>

<p>Noticing these imbalances quickly and objectively is enough for the fire to stop. When you practice long enough, you will notice, in split second, even the slightest imbalance in our hearts. When we could quickly see what is causing our unhappiness, we couldn’t help but ask ourselves, “Why hold on to the hot iron?” This is precisely the reason why meditation or mindfulness is imperative to our happiness.</p>

<p>Mindfulness protects our happiness. It allows us to see the true cause of our unhappiness. It helps us to not be comsumed by our own feelings and instead see it for what it is. Through mindfullness, we become the observer of our unhappiness and not the unhappiness itself.</p>

<!-- <blockquote>Hatred can't be stop by hatred. It only stops by compassion. <br>-Buddha</blockquote>
 -->
<p>I can’t tell you how many times a day these imbalances pop up in my daily life. And every single day for the last 10 years, mindfulness has countlessly saved my happiness. This is why I started True Happiness. This is why I know for sure that it will save your happiness too.</p>

<h2>Self-Transformation</h2>

<p>I used to think I am already “good”. Even when others would give me honest constructive criticisms or useful feedbacks, I would see them as attacks or attempts to delegitimize my identity of being “good”. I prefered to hold on to my image of “good” rather be good. And for that, I can’t grow.</p>

<p>This attitude of being too good for improvement is perhaps the worst attitude anyone could have toward self-growth. According to the Buddha, he considered these people to already be “dead.” For they no longer have anything more to offer because their attempt to hold on to their “goodness” has hinder them of bettering themselves.</p>

<p>Meditation has turn this attitude of mine 360 degrees. What meditation allows one to see is myself for who I really am. Before I was biased toward myself. I thought I was already “good” enough. But once I started seeing myself more and more, I start to see that I was not. I have found many contradictories within myself which I only applies to others but never to myself. I realised my prejudices, and double-standards which many times have causes me troubles. I have come to see my many flaws and shortcomings which I had always overlook and even sometimes blame others for. I have overcome many unwholesome desires which I thought was my “happiness” but turns out just to be an attempt to fill the unfillable void in my heart. The list goes on and on.</p>

<p>The mind is like a garden. If you do not tend it, only weed grows. It is impossible to improve what we do not know because you don’t even know what the thing to be improved is in the first place. This is precisely what meditation allows us to do: seeing ourselves. And if meditation could completely change who I am for the better then it will change yours too.</p>

<h2>Love</h2>

<p>This is not the romantic kind of “love” we know. But this is the love given through Truth. It is the love born out of self-understanding and selflessness. It is the love which comes as the fruits of meditation.</p>

<p>No one is perfect; and I am of no exception. Many times in my life I wanted to yell and insult others who have anger me. Many times in my life I feel jealous of others who are doing better than me. Many times in my life I wanted to hurt others who have hurt me. Many times in my life what wanted to lie and cheat. Without mindfulness, I would have done all those thing without a second-thought because I felt it was right for me to feel such a way. And it was right for me to retaliate. However, nothing good ever comes out of doing, speaking, and thinking when you are emotional.</p>

<p>But I didn’t.</p>

<p>Why? Because each time I faced with such situations, mindfulness was there to help me.</p>

<p>In the situation where I could cheat, did not because I am aware of my unwholesome desire.
In the situation where I could take advantage of others for my own goods, I did not.
In the situation where I know I am better than others but choose never to enjoy that</p>

<p>Mindfulness allows me to see that these thoughts comes and goes.</p>

<p>But every time I was mindful of these thoughts. I couldn’t help but feel compassion for myself for having these thoughts. Instead of letting it comsume my life and who I am, I simply feel compassion for myself. And for that reason, I did not do anything of those things which I know I would regret hundred times over.</p>

<p>If this is not love, then what is? This is the love which benefits all for all eternity.</p>

<p>I let it be without personalising it or denying it. And soon enough it passes away. For me this is love.</p>

<p>It is to</p>

<p>I want to do all these things which I did not.</p>

<p>No one is perfect. I must admit that sometimes I even have the worst thought in my mind. When I see my friend is doing something better than me. I want to destroy him.</p>

<p>It has protected myself from harming others. I have better self-control though mindfulness.</p>

<p>It has protect myself from myself. I have better self-control though mindfulness.</p>

<p>It has given my life purpose.I have found my purpose in life through meditation</p>

<h2>Purpose in Life</h2>

<p>What is the best way of living life both for oneself and for the world?</p>

<p>Every individual lives to seek happiness in one form or another. However, the pursue of one’s happiness does not necessarily mean that it is always beneficial for all. Often time than not, our pursue of happiness only benefit ourselves. And worse, in some cases, it comes at the cost of others.</p>

<p>Happiness must be developed. If it is not developed, then it always</p>

<p>Everyone seeks happiness. However, the pursue of one’s happiness does not necessarily mean that it is always beneficial for all. Often time than not, our pursue of happiness only benefit ourselves. And worse, in some cases, it comes at the cost of others.</p>

<p>Everyone seeks happiness. But why is it so hard to become happy in compare to being discontent with life?</p>

<p>So the question is this, <strong>“What is the best way of living life both for oneself and for the world?”</strong></p>

<p>Meditation</p>

<p>Happiness must be learned and developed or else our happiness will be given by others.</p>

<p>The answer to most of us is simply happiness. But the pursue of one’s happiness does not necessarily mean that it is always beneficial for all. Often time than not, our pursue of happiness only benefit ourselves. And worse, in some cases, at the cost of others.</p>

<p>Everyone seeks happiness. However, the pursue of one’s happiness does not necessarily mean that it is always beneficial for all. Often time than not, our pursue of happiness only benefit ourselves. And worse, in some cases, at the cost of others.</p>

<p>When I truly understood what meditation is and what it is for, I realise that <strong>meditation or the practice of mindfulness is not only the answer for one’s life, but also for world.</strong></p>

<p>It is the best thing to do for oneself and the world. If you seek not just happiness but True Happiness then meditation or the practice of mindfulness is what lies between the two. If you are looking to solve world problem or working for world peace then do not look else where. Because as long as humans do not know how to find the peace inside there can never be peace outside. (For more infomation about why learning True Happiness will save the world, <a href="/principles_of_happiness/why_true_happiness/">Click Here.</a>)</p>

<p>The goal of this website is to introduce everyone to a way of living life that will both be beneficial for oneself and the world. All of which are based upon the goals of improving our ways of seeking happiness, fiding True Happiness, differentiating happiness from True Happiness, learning to be mindful of oneself, finding happiness not taking but in giving.</p>

<p>It will might take a while for anyone to realise what meditation actually is. But for me,</p>

<h2>Truth</h2>

<blockquote>"Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom." - Aristotle
</blockquote>

<p>What originally led me to meditation is not my desire to be happy, but rather my desire to know Truth. It is rather odd how the two coincide. But from my experience, they do and they must. There is no True Happiness without Truth. One would not be wrong to say that finding Truth is also finding True Happiness.</p>

<p>During my time in college, I studied Philosophy. My journey in Philosophy has led to me know Truth. I know that Truth is outside of language. I know that it is the unspeakable. I know that it transcends all dualities of life. But what I am saying to you right now is like describing to you how a dish would taste. I could tell you all about it but in the end it is you who have to taste it to know what it actually taste like. Similarly, Truth can be learned. But it must be experienced through meditation in order to know what it actually is.</p>

<p>Learning the Truth of Life is enjoyable in and of itself. Think of it as learning how to ride a horse. When you don’t know how, it is difficult and stressful to try to steer it. But once you come to learn about the nature of the horse and how to ride it, it is much easier and much more enjoyable. Life is very much the same. The more I became aware of the Truth of life the easier and happier it becomes.</p>

<p>Speaking from what I know, you either live life or the life will live you, one way or the other. And the only difference is whether or not we know life. Knowing life is precisely what meditation is for.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Of course,</p>

<p>And the more you understand yourself the more you understand others, and thus it made it that much easier for me to understand and get along with other people.</p>

<p>What meditation has given me is unrequitable and invaluable.</p>

<p>Even though I have spoken to you about what I have gain/received through meditation, but just as a final note, <strong>meditation is not something anyone should expect to gain anything out of.</strong> The expectation and desire of meditation will make it impossible to succeed in any attempt to meditate. Even though meditation leads you to True Happiness, but you can’t even expect or demand it to make you be happy. Meditation is just about being with ourselves and being mindful of ourselves. So just be careful and meditate for meditation’s sake. That’s how you will find True Happiness.</p>

<p>Beside from the my main list above, calmness, productivity, focus, are the byproduct of meditation. Meditation is the exercise for the mind.</p>

<p>All in all, I am not here to prove to you why you should meditate. Meditation does not need convincing as much as it needs be proven. Thus, give it a try and let meditation speaks its truth to you.</p>

<p>So why do we meditate?</p>

<!-- Now that we understand why we meditate, the next article we will discuss about "How to Meditate?" so that you will know exactly what to do and what not to do. How can you practice.

<hr />

<h2>How does meditation leads one to True Happiness?</h2>

<p>How could we be unhappy if we know everything is impermanent? How could we be unhappy if we know everything will not last forever? How could we be unhappy if we know reality is not about what we want but about the absolute law of cause and effect that determined it? </p>

<p>Meditation allows us to experience a state of stillness. Our mind is not looking for something it wants more. It is not concern about what is troubled what it is does not like. When the mind comes to know this state more and more it comes to experience what true happiness is.</p>

<p>But be careful that the practice of mindfulness is not about not thinking or ignoring or denying the reality of our undesirable thoughts. Mindfulness is simply to be mindful of everything. All thoughts, feelings and everything that come to our senses are <em>allowed.</em> The practice of mindfulness is not a judgement on ourselves or the world. It is not a self-management in which you have to assert control over ourselves. It is simply to be mindful of it.</p>

<p>The more we come to know ourselves for what it is the more we will realise the three noble truth which is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Everything is impermanent--ourselves, our feelings, our attitude, our body.</li>

<li>Nothing lasted.</li>

<li>Reality has nothing to do with what we want.</li>
</ol>

<p>True Happiness is not a path of control. It is a path of acceptance. </p>

<p>How could we be unhappy if we know everything is impermanent? How could we be unhappy if we know everything will not last forever? How could we be unhappy if reality is not about what we want but about the absolute law of cause and effect that determined reality? </p>

<p>We can't. But this is not a know that we can convince our heart and mind to accept. Through our mindfulness, we will let our heart and mind to see these truth for itself. We can say that we know everything is impermanent. But does our heart truly understand that?</p>

<p>There is a huge different between knowing intellectually andk nowing from the heart. </p>

<p>This is probably one of the most unanswered question in meditation. Most people will be satified with the answer that meditation helps you calm your mind or it will increase your productivity. But is that really the reason why? I believe the reasons why there aren’t many good explanation is because people do not know why.</p>
