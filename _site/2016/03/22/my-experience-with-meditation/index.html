				<p>It is not wrong to be curious about meditation and where it would take us. So as a long-time practitioner of mindfulness, here is a short list of what I have recieved/gained in these last 10 years of meditation.</p>

<h2>Happiness</h2>

<blockquote>Make a man happy and he will be happy for a day. Teach a man how to to be happy and he will be happy for a life time.</blockquote>

<p>People today are finding life more difficult to be happy and easier to be discontent. We are always looking for more. Our happiness is never with us but is always in front of us. We have become so out of touch with our happiness that we barely know what happiness actually is anymore. We have become so busy running and jumping from one kind of happiness to the next hoping it would finally fulfil our lives. But the chase never ends.</p>

<p>Meditation is a method which allow us to be in touch with our inner balance. It is not about chasing, but it is about coming home. Whenever our heart is off-balanced by whatever life throws at us, we know because when we are balanced we can quickly discern our imbalances within our hearts. That naturally becomes awareness.</p>

<p>What I mean by “imbalance” is our unhappiness; namely anger, worry, jealousy, greed, frustration, despair, disappointment and etcs. (For more information about what unhappiness is, click <a href="/principles_of_happiness/what_is_happiness/">here</a>.)</p>

<p>When we are unawared of the unhappiness in our lives, the unhappiness spreads in our mind like wildfire. When you are angry at someone and you do not forgive him or her, what you eventually find is yourself saying bad things about him or her in your head. You will start convincing yourself how he or she is a bad person and how you will never talk to them again. So by allowing of inner fire to go wild, we unknowingly fueled our fire of hatred.</p>

<p>Noticing these imbalances quickly and objectively is enough for the fire to stop. When you practice long enough, you will notice, in split second, even the slightest imbalance in our hearts. When we could quickly see what is causing our unhappiness, we couldn’t help but ask ourselves, “why hold on to the hot iron?” This is precisely the reason why meditation or mindfulness is imperative to our happiness.</p>

<p>Mindfulness protects our happiness. It allows us to see the true cause of our unhappiness. It allows us to not be comsumed by our own feelings and instead see it for what it is. Through mindfullness, we become the observer of our unhappiness and not the unhappiness itself.</p>

<!-- <blockquote>Hatred can't be stop by hatred. It only stops by compassion. <br>-Buddha</blockquote>
 -->
<p>I can’t tell you how many times a day these imbalances pop up in my daily life. And every single day for the last 10 years, mindfulness has countlessly saved my happiness. This is why I started True Happiness. This is why I know for sure that it will save your happiness too.</p>

<h2>Self-Transformation</h2>

<p>I used to think I am already “good”. Even when others would give me honest constructive criticisms or useful feedbacks, I would see them as attacks or attempts to delegitimize my claim of being “good”. I love myself more than I love my growth. And for that, I can’t grow.</p>

<p>This attitude of being too good for improvement is perhaps the worst attitude anyone could have toward self-growth. According to the Buddha, he considered these people already “dead.” For they no longer have any more to offer because their attempt to hold on to their “goodness” has hinder them of improving themselves.</p>

<p>Meditation has turn this attitude of mine 360 degrees. What meditation allows one to see is myself for who I really am. Before I thought I was biased toward myself. I thought I was perfect. But once I started seeing myself more and more, I start to see that I was not. I have found many contradictories within myself which I only applies to others but never to myself. I realised my double-standards. I have come to see my many flaws and shortcomings which I had always overlook and even sometimes blame others for. I have overcome many unwholesome desires which I thought was my “happiness” but turns out just to be an attempt to fill the unfillable void in my heart. The list goes on and on.</p>

<p>The mind is like a garden. If you do not tend it, only weed grows. And there are a lot of weeds. It is impossible to improve what we do not know because you don’t even know what the thing to be improved is in the first place. This is precisely what meditation allows us to do: seeing ourselves. And if meditation could completely change who I am for the better then it will change yours too.</p>

<h2>Love</h2>

<p>This is not the romantic kind of “love” we know. But this is the love given through Truth. It is the love born out of self-understanding and selflessness. It is the love which comes as the fruits of meditation.</p>

<p>No one is perfect; and I am no exception. Many times in my life I wanted to yell and insult others who have anger me. Many times in my life I feel jealous of others who are doing better than me. Many times in my life I wanted to hurt others who have hurt me. Many times in my life what wanted to lie and cheat. But I didn’t.</p>

<p>Why? Because each time I faced with such situations, mindfulness was there to help me.</p>

<p>In the situation where I could cheat, did not because I am aware of my unwholesome desire.
In the situation where I could take advantage of others for my own goods, I did not.
In the situation where I know I am better than others but choose never to enjoy that</p>

<p>Mindfulness allows me to see that these thoughts comes and goes.</p>

<p>But every time I was mindful of these thoughts. I couldn’t help but feel compassion for myself for having these thoughts. Instead of letting it comsume my life and who I am, I simply feel compassion for myself. And for that reason, I did not do anything of those things which I know I would regret hundred times over.</p>

<p>If this is not love, then what is? This is the love which benefits all for all eternity.</p>

<p>I let it be without personalising it or denying it. And soon enough it passes away. For me this is love.</p>

<p>It is to</p>

<p>I want to do all these things which I did not.</p>

<p>No one is perfect. I must admit that sometimes I even have the worst thought in my mind. When I see my friend is doing something better than me. I want to destroy him.</p>

<p>It has protected myself from harming others. I have better self-control though mindfulness.</p>

<p>It has protect myself from myself. I have better self-control though mindfulness.</p>

<p>It has given my life purpose.I have found my purpose in life through meditation</p>

<h2>Purpose in Life</h2>
<p>n or 
This might sounds far fetched; however, when I truly understood what meditation is and what it is for, I realise that meditation or the practice of mindfulness is the answer for one’s life as well as the world.</p>

<p>This might sounds far fetch; but when I truly understands what meditation is and what it is for then perhaps you will come to a similar conclusion that <strong>meditation or the practice of mindfulness is the answer for one’s life as well as the world.</strong> So let me back up a bit and explain to you why is that so.</p>

<p>The first reason is simply because everybody wants to be happy and meditation is the bridge between happiness and True Happiness. Happiness is not enough. Happiness</p>

<p>The second reason is that</p>

<p>First of all, everyone wants to be happy. But not every happiness is fulfilling and is the end of all seeking of happiness like the kind of happiness meditation could offer. Meditation is what lies between us and True Happiness. By coming in touch with the Truth of life, one comes to see life as it is. This</p>

<p>Meditation is not only to sit down and close our eyes. The goal of meditation is not just that. The goal of meditation is to</p>

<p>The relationship that we are trying to perfect is the relationship between one and onself, and one with the world.</p>

<p>Happiness is ultimately what we all seek. And meditation is what allow one to know True Happiness.</p>

<p>Meditation’s role to the practitioner is that it is a way of improving oneself by understanding one’s nature. By understanding one’s nature, it allows us to</p>

<p>Meditation is the best thing to do if one hope to change the world. This might sounds far fetch but let me retrace the logic for you.</p>

<p>Meditation helps one to be happier. But meditation also helps the world to be a better place.</p>

<p>Since I know my way around in the nature of myself I could help others as well.</p>

<h2>Truth</h2>

<blockquote>"Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom." - Aristotle
</blockquote>

<p>There is a huge different between knowing Truth and living Truth. My journey so far has led to me know Truth. But only through the practice of mindfulness that would allow me to live Truth.</p>

<p>Anyone could know Truth, it is not hard.</p>

<p>I have come to understand the truth of life.</p>

<p>What meditation has given me is unrequitable and invaluable.</p>

<p>Even though I have spoken to you about what I have gain/recieved through meditation, but just as a final note, <strong>meditation is not something anyone should expect to gain anything out of.</strong> The expectation and desire will make it impossible to succeed in our attempt to meditate. You can’t even expect or demand it to make you be happy. Meditation is just about being with ourselves and being mindful of ourselves. So just be careful and meditate for meditation’s sake. That’s how you will find True Happiness.</p>

<p>Beside from the my main list above, calmness, productivity, focus, are the byproduct of meditation. Meditation is the exercise for the mind.</p>

<p>So why do we meditate?</p>

<p>Now that we understand why we meditate, the next article we will discuss about “How to Meditate?” so that you will know exactly what to do and what not to do. How can you practice.</p>

<hr />

<h2>How does meditation leads one to True Happiness?</h2>

<p>How could we be unhappy if we know everything is impermanent? How could we be unhappy if we know everything will not last forever? How could we be unhappy if we know reality is not about what we want but about the absolute law of cause and effect that determined it? </p>

<p>Meditation allows us to experience a state of stillness. Our mind is not looking for something it wants more. It is not concern about what is troubled what it is does not like. When the mind comes to know this state more and more it comes to experience what true happiness is.</p>

<p>But be careful that the practice of mindfulness is not about not thinking or ignoring or denying the reality of our undesirable thoughts. Mindfulness is simply to be mindful of everything. All thoughts, feelings and everything that come to our senses are <em>allowed.</em> The practice of mindfulness is not a judgement on ourselves or the world. It is not a self-management in which you have to assert control over ourselves. It is simply to be mindful of it.</p>

<p>The more we come to know ourselves for what it is the more we will realise the three noble truth which is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Everything is impermanent--ourselves, our feelings, our attitude, our body.</li>

<li>Nothing lasted.</li>

<li>Reality has nothing to do with what we want.</li>
</ol>

<p>True Happiness is not a path of control. It is a path of acceptance. </p>

<p>How could we be unhappy if we know everything is impermanent? How could we be unhappy if we know everything will not last forever? How could we be unhappy if reality is not about what we want but about the absolute law of cause and effect that determined reality? </p>

<p>We can't. But this is not a know that we can convince our heart and mind to accept. Through our mindfulness, we will let our heart and mind to see these truth for itself. We can say that we know everything is impermanent. But does our heart truly understand that?</p>

<p>There is a huge different between knowing intellectually andk nowing from the heart. </p>

<h2>How is it related to mindfulness?</h2>

<h2>Life Changing</h2>

<p>Meditation is the tool to make us happy.</p>

<p>Meditation is the path for you to learn the truth about life. Once your mind comes to understand its own true nature, the result is our ability to</p>

<p>This is probably one of the most unanswered question in meditation. Most people will be satified with the answer that meditation helps you calm your mind or it will increase your productivity. But is that really the reason why? I believe the reasons why there aren’t many good explanation is because people do not know why.</p>
