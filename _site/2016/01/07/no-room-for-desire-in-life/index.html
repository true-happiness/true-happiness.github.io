				<p>If I know water would boil at a 100 degrees Celsius. Do I need to hope it would boil at 100 degree Celsius? Or even if I do not want the water to be boiled, could I desire the water not to be boiled even if I heat it up to 100 degrees Celsius?</p>

<p>Similarly, I can hope, dance, or pray—or do all three at once—for it to rain tomorrow. However, if the causes are not right, it will not rain. Or maybe I do not want it to rain tomorrow. But again, if the conditions are right for it rain, it will rain regardless of what I want or don’t want.</p>

<p>The simple yet elegant wisdom that I am attempting to reiterate here is this:</p>

<blockquote>Reality has nothing to do with what one wants. Instead, reality has everything to do with the law of cause and effect.</blockquote>

<p>If the causes are right for an effect to occur, it will occur regardless of what one wants or do not want. Scientifically speaking, there is no room for desires in reality. There is only cause and effect.</p>

<p>The common way, we, humans, achieve happiness in life is to put what we desire in front of the causes we must perform to achieve the result. When we start a project we want the project to be finished right away. When we live we don’t want to die. When we are rich we never want to be poor. When we become somebody we are fearful of being nobody. We are always putting what we want in front of what the reality is. For this reason, we have become constantly fearful, worried, impatient, and frustrated by what we are afraid would not turn out like what we desire.</p>

<p>There are two ways of achieving anything in life. One is to put your desire in front of what the reality is. Second is to work toward your goal without having the need to get ahead of ourselves. In other words, to work with and according to reality, not work for what you want from reality.</p>

<p>You do not need desire in your life to achieve whatever you set out. Your duty in life is not to your desire; but your duty in life is to the law of cause and effect. By creating the right causes, you could attain anything in life <em>with or without</em> the need to desire for it.</p>

<p>The only difference between these two approaches is the difference between being the happinest man alive or being miserable. The man who puts his desire in front of his reality is never satisfied, for his happiness always lies ahead of what is. Happiness is therefore fleeting by always being in front of him. He can never be happy until his goal and desire is fulfilled. While the man whose desire is with reality is always satisfied with what is. Since his desire is in tune with reality, he is not anxious or worry. This, in turn, allows him to become more productive while at the same time have a peace of mind while working toward his goal.</p>

<p>When someone—like me—is applying for graduate school I might, right away, desires to be accepted. But who am I to want or not want things from reality without ever creating the right causes for it to happen? Because in reality, whether or not anyone would or would not be accepted has many different factors—many beyond one’s control. So just by applying or having a great supporting resume doesn’t mean I have the right or the claim or demand from reality my admission. So why desire? Why worry? Why put your desires ahead of reality? And why not channel this energy, instead, at creating the right causes, which are writing the best application?</p>

<p>All in all, the message here is simple: life is happier, better, and more satisfactory if one lives in accordance with reality and its law rather than living in accordance with what one wants from reality. Reality does not revolves around what one wants from it; it revolves around the absolute law of cause and effect. Thus, life is never like what one wants it to be. The only way for anyone to feel the unsatisfactoriness of life is to be unmindful of the law of conditionality and desire life or reality to be the way one wants. So let’s keep our feet on the ground; and stay with reality and its law. Never forget that the way to live happily, correctly, and more efficiently, is not to put our desires in front of our action, but the other way around.</p>

<blockquote>
	Life doesn't not revolve around what we desire from reality because reality revolve around the absolute law of cause and effect.
