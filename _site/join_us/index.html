<h3>5. Become a Editor</h3>

<p>I am not a native English speaker. Thus, what I need is someone to read over my content before posting on True Happiness. An editor should to be able to correct my grammar as well as give constructive advice on how to improve my writing.</p>

<h3>6. Sponsor True Happiness's Vision</h3>
<blockquote>“Educating the mind without educating the heart is no education at all.”
- Aristotle</blockquote>

<p>My vision is to open a university.</p>

<p>Education teaches about the truth and nature of many things from smallest insect to vastness of our universe. Yet, it never teaches about the truth and nature of the students themselves.</p>

<p>The function of education today is merely to put power in the hands of the students without teaching them how to exercise it. As a result, we have opened up the world where the fortunate could use their fortune to take advantage of those who are less fortunate. Those who received the best education today are judged based on his or her ability to perform more than his or her reason or purpose to perform. Thus, graduating from top universities does not mean he or she will enter the world thinking about how to better it. Theodore Roosevelt once said:</p>

<blockquote>"A man who has never gone to school may steal a freight car; but if he has a university education, he may steal the whole railroad."</blockquote>

<p>Wealth will not stop people from their greed. And more power will not stop people from abusing power. Thus, giving students more power without teaching them how to exercise it is definitely not a good idea. What we need is a holistic approach to education where we do not merely ask the question of what and how. But why.</p>

<p>Why do we study at all? Is it for one's personal ends or is it for the betterment of this world? Students ought to build their "why" to this world as much as the "how" to this world. Because without being able to ask the "why" question, students are left astray in the abyss of not knowing why they were born. Why study? Why are we all here in this world? And what is the best way of living life, one that is beneficial for both ourselves and for this world?</p>

<p>By developing the knowledge outside as well as inside of ourselves, this university will grow students who are both capable and compassionate. By learning more about themselves, the students will be building their character, developing their happiness in life as well as discovering where their passion belong - something which schools today rarely taught. Academically, this university should be indepth and rigorous. It will drive its academic performance not by grade or exams but how well it can inspires the student to learn; or in other words, passion.</p>

<blockquote>"Education is the kindling of a flame, not the filling of a vessel." - Socrates</blockquote>

<p>The purpose of education is to help, not to judge or hinder. It's not teaching students how to memorize for exams. It is not to evaluate students through a single golden standardized test.  It is not to judge the students and decides or limits who they are and what they can become. The focus of this school is simply to help the student to learn how to develop both their hearts and their minds. Many schools today are teaching our kids how to take well. Here, we teaches our children how give well. And that is exactly what this university will do.</p>

<p>With the right support and the right team, I truly believe that if this university comes to life, it will be the best university in the world. It would revolutionize the way education is and has been. It will help change and save many lives. Its students will graduate with the passion to serve and have a strong desire to improve themselves not only for themselves but for all.  It will be the driving force which drives the world in the right direction.</p>

<p>I believe a better world is possible. If you are interested, want to support this ambitious cause, or join as part of the team, do not hesitate to <a href="/contact">contact</a>. The change begins now!</p>
