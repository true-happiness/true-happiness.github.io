        <title>Cause of Unhappiness Part Five: When Life Is At A Lost</title>
        <dc:creator>Supakorn Laohasongkram</dc:creator>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There will be times when life becomes too overwhelming. There will be times in our lives where we have no idea how to go on. There will be times where doubt, fear, confusion, and uncertainty will set in and cloud our minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this age of information where we are constantly bombarded by the tales of what we should want in life. “You have to get a degree from college in order to be happy.” “You need a new phone in order to look good in front of your friends.” “You need that job/promotion.” “You have to have that big house to be ‘successful’.” “You need to get married by this age or else it will be impossible afterward.” On and on and on we are fed by stories of what “happiness” is suppose to be. But instead, these so called “happiness” often times left us with a sense inadequancy to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what should one do when life is at a lost? Here are four simple steps to getting your life back on track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4 Steps to Get Your Life Back&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Stop and Take A Step Back&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;One evening I return to my hermitage from a walk in the hills, and I found that all the doors and windows of the hermitage had been blown open. When I left the house, I hadn&#39;t secured them, and a cold wind blew through the house, opened the windows, and scattered the papers from the desk all over the room. Immediately I closed the doors and the windows, lit a lamp, picked up the papers, and arranged them neatly on my desk. Then I started a fire in the fireplace, and soon the crackiling logs brought warmth back to the room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Thich Nhat Hanh&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above is exactly what we do with our life when it is at a lost. Thich Nhat Hanh equates our senses as the doors and windows of our life. &lt;strong&gt;You can’t pick yourself up in the middle of the storm.&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes it is wise to just stop and take a step back from it all. Of course, the purpose of this is not to give up. Its purpose is to give ourselves the chance to recover and prepare to face life again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To stop and take a step back from life could be anything from spending time with yourself, a solo vacation, meditate, to participating in a meditation retreat. I do not recommend losing yourself into something or putting the problem off by blurring the reality of the situation like making ourselves busy on purpose or go out to do something just to forget the problem. The point is not to run away but to allow you to step a out of your situation to look inward and review your life so that you can begin anew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;capitalized&quot;&gt;2. Understand that it’s ok to be lost.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It&#39;s ok to not be ok.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life never goes according to what one wants. This is the fact of life. So it&#39;s inevitable for everyone to, at some point, not be ok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the worst and best thing that one can do at this point?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The worst thing anyone could do&lt;/strong&gt; when facing such a situation is to hate the situation one is in. Imagine you are lost in a desert with someone and that person just kept brooding, crying out loud, throwing tantrum, and complaining about the situation. How does that help make the situation any better if not worse? To hate the situation you are in is, therefore, like digging you own grave. It only makes everything worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its worse form, it creates an infinite down spiral. When one dislikes the situation one is in one tends to become dishearten and give up the whole thing which makes the situation even worse. And when the situation is worse, it makes one wants to give up even more. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best thing that one could do&lt;/strong&gt; when lost is simply to focus on the problem in front of us in order to put our lives back again. Don&#39;t victimized yourself. See how others might even be in worse situation. Don&#39;t complain. Learn to be opened to the problems of life is a skill. Be nice to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;capitalized&quot;&gt;3. Regaining your sense of direction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have given yourself an opportunity to stop and take a step out of your situation and you are calm and collected enough to face the challenges of life then it is time to find your sense of direction in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding one’s sense of direction required alot of inner and outer exploration. The questions which one should aim to answer are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What matters to me most?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What is the purpose of living?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What am I passionate about?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What is my core value?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What is my inner drive?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What cause do I believe in that is higher than myself?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s ok to not be able to answer these questions. Many never found their true sense of direction in life until late in their life. It is not something you can’t rush it because it has its own time. However, to help you find what drives you. Here are some advises:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&#39;t Overthink. Just Explore.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefit of being lost is that it forces you to explore. It forces you to find your inner drive. So take this chance and learn more about yourself and find what it is that you truly believe in. Learn something new. Meet new and inspiring people. Live life differently from what you used to. Perhaps the reason why you are lost is because you haven&#39;t try that thing which you always wanted to try. Very much like when you are lost in real life in a middle of a jungle. You probably first need to know and assess what you&#39;ve got, where you want to head toward, and see what is in your surrounding that could be of use. So get exploring both inside and outside. And try your best to not to do it out of fear, but out of joy.
	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simplify&lt;/strong&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The reason why we are sometimes confused with life is because we have too many wants--some which are even conflicting with one another. Having too much wants makes our lives become too difficult to manage. As a rule of thumb, a simple life always lead to happiness. So find whatever that matters to you most and let go of others which are not. In this way, you have a clearer sense of the direction which you want to head toward.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revisit Your Inner Drive&lt;/strong&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;If you are feeling lost then you must have known what it was like to not be lost. Revisit your past when you feel sure of life or when you felt you have a sense of purpose could be helpful to getting you back on track.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Keep Going, Do Not Give Up.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Players with fight never lose a game, they just run out of time&quot; - John Wooden&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are never lost until you give up. So never give up. Keep going. Eventually you will find your way. Perhaps it is not the path you were expecting. But you will find it. It’s only a matter of patient, perseverance, and time. You have my full support! If you would like to share you story for others to help and support you or become an inspiration to others. You can do so at &lt;a href=&quot;/forum/&quot;&gt;True Happiness’s Forum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Meditate?</title>
        <dc:creator>Supakorn Laohasongkram</dc:creator>
        <description>&lt;h2 class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;Meditation is simply to know.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Know” in this sense is not knowing in our thoughts or knowing from reading, listening, or thinking but knowing as in &lt;em&gt;to experience, be aware of, or be mindful of.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do we know in meditation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objects that we must know in meditation are ourselves. The self can be divided into two main parts: &lt;strong&gt;the mind and the body&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it could further be separated it into five parts which are..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Body&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Consciousness&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Knowledge&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Thoughts&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Feeling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the objects of meditations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do we do once we are mindful of our body, consciousness, knowledge, thoughts, and feeling?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing. Simply by being mindful of ourselves is enough. This might sounds very strange in this age where one has to always do more or always take a more active stance in achieving something. But this is not the case for meditation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the correct way to know in meditation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Know objectively as is. Without any need to change or to desire how our body, consciousness, knowledge, thoughts, and feeling should or should not be. If you are upset, know that you are upset. If we have a stomach ache, know that we have the stomach ache. This is how we develop our mindfulness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why should I develop my mindfulness? What is the purpose of meditation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of meditation is to allow the mind to see its own reality. Our life is full of ups and downs, positive emotions and negative emotions, good thoughts and bad thoughts, birth and death, and of knowledge of what is “good” and “evil”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we live and navigate in the world which is full of these dualities of life is the real question that one must know the answer to live a  happy life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When life is not going the way we want we can always say to ourselves that, “life is uncertain” or that “it will soon pass.” But do our hearts really accept this fact? Even with the knowledge that life is uncertain, we still suffer. For this reason, knowing by knowledge is not enough. What we need is to know life by heart. This is why meditation is needed as the tool for our hearts to come to know truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By allowing our hearts to see the dualities of life, we can see that life with its ups and downs has three characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everything is impermanent.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Nothing lasted.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Reality has nothing to do with what we want, but it has everything to do with the natural law of cause and effect. &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/07/no-room-for-desire-in-life/&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;(For a more detailed explanation, click here.)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meditation is how one comes to understand reality. It is how our hearts learn about how everything comes and goes, how all must inevitably progress from birth to death, and how the world is not about what we want but about the absolute law of cause and effect. These are the truth that our hearts will come to see for itself just by being mindful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the hearts could come to understand the truth of life. Life becomes easier to live and harder for it to suffer. Like learning how to ride a horse, if you do not know how, riding becomes a nightmare. And often times than not, the horse rides you more than you ride the horse. Life is very much the same. This is why one must learn life to live it. And meditation is how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Types of Meditation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Meditation in Daily Life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important type of meditation is not one in which most people believe. Many have the idea of meditation as sitting down, closing our eyes, and watch our breathing. But for meditation to be effective it must be practical in our daily life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there are two ways one could develop mindfulness in our daily life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Being mindful of our mind&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Our mind consists of our consciousness, knowledge, thoughts, and feelings. Consciousness&#39;s only task is to know. Knowledge is what we know. Thoughts are our cognitive thinking. And feeling is... feeling! (However, it could be further generalized into three types of feelings: positive, negative, and neutral.)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;We develop our mindfulness by noticing our thoughts and feelings. When a thought takes our mind from places to places we know our mind is wandering. When we are happy, we know that we are happy. When we are sad we know that we are sad. This is all it takes to develop mindfulness. (Really?) Really!&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Being mindful of our body&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;In our daily life, we can develop our mindfulness by knowing our bodies in the present moment like when we are breathing, walking, eating, sitting, and etc. Simple right? Just know our bodily movement through out the day and we are all set!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, meditation in daily life is to know our body, consciousness, knowledge, thoughts, and feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How much daily meditation is enough?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;All day is enough. True practictioners of mindfulness begin their practice starting from the moment they wake up until the moment they go to bed. They are mindful of when they get out of bed, brush their teeth, eat, walk, go to work, come home, and go to bed. They are mindful of all their positive or negative thoughts and emotions through out the day. The practice of mindfulness is easy; but to practice it consistently through out the day is not. Slowly build your mindfulness in daily life until it becomes a second-nature.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Sitting and Walking Meditation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sitting Meditation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Sitting meditation is ultimately to be mindful of our in breath and out breath. Let&#39;s first begin with the steps:&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;ol&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find a suitable spot for sitting meditation. Preferably any place that is quiet and give you a sense of peace and tranquility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sit in a comfortable position. It is not required for you to sit on the floor. Sitting on a chair would do. But I would recommend that the chair should not be too comfortable because it would make you fall asleep!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can begin noticing your out breath and in breath with your eyes open or closed. If you easily get sleepy while doing your sitting meditation then it would be good to start with your eyes open and just notice the in and out breath before closing your eyes once you feel more concentrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuosly be mindful of the breath. If you mind wanders, simply bring it back to the breath and continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;These are the steps to sitting meditation which can seem pretty simple but once you are into the practice and actuality of doing it, it is not. So here are some tips.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;u&gt;Quick Tips on Sitting Meditation&lt;/u&gt;
		
		&lt;p&gt;Meditation is not about control nor is it about letting the mind runs loose. The trick is to find the perfect balance between controlling and not. To know the breath by being not too tight and not too loose. Sitting meditation is like holding a chick. If you hold it too loosely it runs away. If you hold it too tightly, the chick suffocates. If you find yourself feeling tight, stiff, having a headache, or finding it difficult to just breathe during or after meditation then it is a clear sign that you are exerting too much control. If you are sleepy, find your mind wandering from places to places without being able to come back to the breath, then it might be possible that you are too loose. Learning sitting meditaiton is like learning how to ride a bike. It will take time and experience to adjust and know your own balance. And practice is key to finding it.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walking Meditation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Since my practice in walking meditation has been trained from the Theravada Buddhist tradition. I want to offer what I know from my own experience. So follow the links below to learn about how as well as why we do walking meditation. (Make sure you turn on the subtitle.) This knowledge will also aid you in your sitting meditation since it pretty much has the same concept.
&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zJRBu5uYrjI&quot;&gt;Video on &quot;How to practice walking meditation?&quot; #2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How much sitting/walking meditation is enough?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Twice a day. I would suggest to make this into a habit by chaining it with some daily routine you have been doing. For example, right after you shower or before you go to bed. It does not need to be a hour long session. In fact one minute would do. But the important thing is to not lose the routine. Once you keep the routine for around 3 weeks, the habit of meditating will stick with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I can only show you the door. But you are the only who has to walk through it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, I could talk all day about how you should meditate; but in the end you have to do it. Only through meditation will you find out for yourself what meditation actually is. You can’t learn how to ride a horse or swim from just reading a textbook. You must do it to learn it. Life is where we can learn about life’s truth. This is why &lt;strong&gt;meditation is defined as the process of knowing oneself&lt;/strong&gt;. Enough talking and start doing!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;last forever. that is true today will be true tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry if this website read like a textbook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not trying to prove myself anything. I am not trying to be cool. I am not trying to gain popularity or build a reputation. I am not trying to sound sophisicated just to look “smart.” I am not trying to be poetic to appeal anyone’s sense of aesthetism.  I am not trying to be an elitist. I do not claim to know everything to life. What I simply want to offer you how to truly be happy. That’s all. I write only what I believe will be enough for you to be happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal is to offer you truth. I am not telling you to believe me.

That is all.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>When You Love, You Become Love</title>
        <dc:creator>Supakorn Laohasongkram</dc:creator>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;And in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make.&quot; ― The Beatles&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything is and can be the object of our love. When we exercise our capacity to love on anything at all–ourselves, love ones, stranger, work, pets or even an insect–we become love itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This site is about finding True Happiness. And love is definitely one of the ways in which one could come to understand and experience True Happiness. But unlike the convention kind of romantic love, the kind of love we are talking about is an act of compassion and selflessness, to look beyond ourselves for the well-being of others without expecting anything in return. It is an act done entirely for the benefits of others. There is no exchange in this kind of love. It is not a give and take. We get nothing for it. It is a &lt;strong&gt;gift&lt;/strong&gt; in its truest sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many believe it is never worth it to do anything if it does not pay. Just like this website, many have told me it is a waste of time to write these articles on True Happiness. Their logic is that if it does not generate income then it is, in their exact words, “useless”, “a waste of time”, “never going to work.” But this website is not intented to be an exchange for me to gain something. &lt;em&gt;It’s a gift.&lt;/em&gt; It is to love others even though there is nothing in return. It is an investment in a relationship that may or may not work at all. I am pouring my heart and soul into this blind shot in the dark all in the hope that it will help someone in their life to find love, peace, truth, purpose, and happiness. I am betting everything to get nothing and it is fine by me because I am happy to love first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Love is Happiness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love is probably one of the strongest emotion. It dominates and dissipates all doubts, hates, politics, and the dramas of human’s life. You will be surprised how quickly can love turn your day around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We always think that we would be happy if others love us. But what we do not realise is that we would be just as happy if we were to love others. So stop wanting to be loved, and start looking for ways to love. Look no further to find True Happiness because &lt;strong&gt;True Happiness is in the very act of love.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dalai Lama once said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;If you want others to be happy, practice compassion. If you want to be happy, practice compassion.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all have the capacity for love. So exercise it. And exercise it often epecially on those who you dislike. Exercise it on yourself and everything that come into your life until it becomes your nature to love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you look at someone, always ask the question of “How can I love?” or “How can I love this person?” Just in that very thought, you are already setting up yourself to be happy. Regardless of who he is she is or what he or she has done to you, this is our &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; duty. It’s perhaps the only attitude we all should have toward life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Let no one ever come to you without leaving better and happier. Be the living expression of God&#39;s kindness: kindness in your face, kindness in your eyes, kindness in your smile.&quot; - Mother Teresa&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This task is not limited to others but it can be applied to anything at anytime. So you can also ask question like “How can I love myself?” or “What is the best thing to do for myself right now?” Even ill thoughts and negative feelings that enter our mind, they are also the objects of our love. I have been waking up with the question of “How can I love today?” It’s a great question to start the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- We always want to be loved by others, but rarely do we want to love others. So let&#39;s change that.
 --&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to leave you with these beautiful and memorable quotes below which I believe better summarise my point about love and True Happiness. (I think it would also be a good ideas to put these quotes up on our desks and in our bedrooms.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;“Seize the moments of happiness, love and be loved! That is the only reality in the world, all else is folly. It is the one thing we are interested in here.” 
― Leo Tolstoy&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;short&quot; /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;“For every minute you are angry you lose sixty seconds of happiness.” 
― Ralph Waldo Emerson&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;short&quot; /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;“The Paradoxical Commandments&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

People are illogical, unreasonable, and self-centered.
Love them anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

If you do good, people will accuse you of selfish ulterior motives.
Do good anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

If you are successful, you will win false friends and true enemies.
Succeed anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The good you do today will be forgotten tomorrow.
Do good anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Honesty and frankness make you vulnerable.

        <title>My Experience With Meditation</title>
        <dc:creator>Supakorn Laohasongkram</dc:creator>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It is not wrong to be curious about meditation and where it would take us. So as a long-time practitioner of mindfulness, here is a short list of what I have received in these last 10 years of meditation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Happiness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Make a man happy and he will be happy for a day. Teach a man how to be happy and he will be happy for a life time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People today are finding life more difficult to be happy and easier to be discontent. The reason is because our happiness has become both fleeting and is always in front of us. We often think, “I’ll be happy if…”, “I’ll be happy when…” Thus, our happiness is always in the future. Never is our happiness with us in this very moment. We have become so busy running and jumping from one kind of happiness to the next hoping it would finally fulfil our lives. But the chase never ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;If you can&#39;t be happy now. You will never be happy.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meditation is a method which allows us to be in touch with our inner balance. It is not about chasing, but about coming home. When we are in touch with our inner balance, we become more conscious of our inner imbalances. And that is how mindfulness builds and becomes awareness. What I mean by “imbalance” is our unhappiness; namely anger, worry, jealousy, greed, frustration, despair, disappointment and etc. (For more information about what unhappiness is, click &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/01/what_is_happiness/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether or not we will be happy or unhappy all depends on how much we can be awared of our own imbalances. When we are unawared of the unhappiness in our lives, the unhappiness spreads in our mind like wildfire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are angry at someone and you do not forgive him or her, what you eventually find is yourself saying bad things about him or her in your head. You will start convincing yourself how he or she is a bad person and how you will never talk to them again. So by allowing our inner fire to go wild, we unknowingly fueled our fire of hatred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noticing these imbalances quickly and objectively is enough for the fire to stop. When you practice long enough, you will notice, in split second, even the slightest imbalance in our hearts. When we could quickly see what is causing our unhappiness, we couldn’t help but ask ourselves, “Why hold on to the hot iron?” This is precisely the reason why meditation or mindfulness is imperative to our happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mindfulness protects our happiness.&lt;/strong&gt; It allows us to see the true cause of our unhappiness. It helps us to not be consumed by our own feelings and instead see it for what it is. Through mindfulness, we become the observer of our unhappiness and not the unhappiness itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- &lt;blockquote&gt;Hatred can&#39;t be stop by hatred. It only stops by compassion. &lt;br&gt;-Buddha&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t tell you how many times a day these imbalances pop up in my daily life. And every single day for the last 10 years, mindfulness has countlessly saved my happiness. This is why I started True Happiness. This is why I know for sure that it will save your happiness too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Self-Transformation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to think I am already “good”. Even when others gave me honest constructive criticisms or useful feedbacks, I would see them as “attacks” or attempts to delegitimize my identity of being “good”. I prefered to hold on to my image of being “good” rather than be good. And for that, I can’t grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This attitude of being too good for improvement is perhaps the worst attitude anyone could have toward self-growth. According to the Buddha, he considered these people to already be “dead.” For they no longer have anything more to offer because their attempts to hold on to their “goodness” has hinder them of bettering themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meditation has turn this attitude of mine 360 degrees. What meditation allows me to see is myself for who I really am. Before I was biased toward myself. I thought I was already “good”. And there is nothing more I need to improve. But once I started seeing myself more and more, I start to see that I was not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have found many contradictions within myself which I only apply to others but never to myself. I realised my prejudices and double-standards which many times have causes me many troubles without me seeing itse negative effects. I have come to see my many flaws and shortcomings which I had always overlook and sometimes even blamed others for. I have overcame many unwholesome desires which I thought was my “happiness” but turns out just to be the attempts to fill the unfillable void in my heart. The list goes on and on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mind is like a garden. If you do not tend it, only weed grows. It is impossible to improve what we do not know because you don’t even know what the thing to be improved is in the first place. Seeing ourselves is precisely what meditation allows us to do. And if meditation could completely change who I am for the better then it will change yours too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Love&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not the romantic kind of “love” we know. But this is the love that is found and given out of self-understanding and selflessness. It is the love which comes as the fruits of meditation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one is perfect; and I am of no exception. Many times in my life I wanted to yell and insult others who have angered me. Many times in my life I feel jealous of others who are doing better than me. Many times in my life I wanted to hurt others who have hurt me. Many times in my life I wanted to lie and cheat to quickly get whatever I want in life. But I never did any of those things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Because I kept my practice and was mindful of these unwholesome desires. I can’t command what kind of thought would pop up in my mind. I can’t tell my feelings to never feel bad. I can’t tell my stomach ache to stop being painful. These are my realities. However, what I can do is how I response to it. And I simply choose to be mindful of it instead of giving in to it. This is meditation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I become mindful of my own reality. I start seeing myself as something which comes and goes. I learn to not take my negative thought and feeling seriously. I start seeing myself as something which has death as its final destination, I learn to let go of my unhappiness knowing life is too short to be unhappy. I start seeing myself as part of the absolute law of cause and effect, I know that everything happens because there are conditions for it to happen. Thus, I can easily come to terms with reality whether it is good or bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The practice of mindfulness is an upward spiral which helps one to be better than oneself. Each time I come to understand and let go of one unwholesome desire, I became better and better at handling the next. This is self-mastery. If you truly love yourself this is what you do. If you seek happiness and truth, meditation is what you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I can overcome my unwholesome desire, I am in the process stop myself from harming others. This for me is love–one which is good for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Purpose in Life&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every individual lives to seek happiness in one form or another. However, the pursue of one’s happiness does not necessarily mean that it is always beneficial for all. Often time than not, our pursues of happiness only benefit ourselves. And worse, in some cases, they come at the cost of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the best way of living life–one that is beneficial for both oneself and the world? What is the best way to solve world problem and social problem of today? What is the best step to take toward creating the condition for world peace? &lt;strong&gt;What is the best thing life can offer?&lt;/strong&gt; These are the questions I have since 18.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my journey to answer these questions, I began studying Philosophy. I traveled, backpacked, and lived in India, France, Japan and many others countries around the world. I even ordained as a Theravada Buddhist monk for one year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After years of ceaselessly searching for the answer, the answer I have found is happiness. Happiness is what create our world, for good or for evil. It dictates people’s lives and decides how our world will be. Wealth will not save this world from itself. Even if it rains in gold today, people’s greed will not end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;World peace can not be achieved by changing what is outside of us, it is achieved by developing how each and everyone of us seek and define happiness inside of ourselves.&lt;/strong&gt; And meditation is the tool for developing our happiness. Through the practice of mindfulness, not only will we find both Truth and True Happiness, but in the process benefits the world as well. It is the best thing that one can do for oneself as well as the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Truth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom.&quot; - Aristotle&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What originally led me to meditation is not my desire to be happy, but my desire to know Truth. It is rather odd how the two coincide. But from my experience, they do and they must. There is no True Happiness without Truth. One would not be wrong to say that finding Truth is also finding True Happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my time in college, I studied Philosophy. My journey in Philosophy has led me to know Truth. I know that Truth is outside of language. I know that it is the Unspeakable. I know that it transcends all dualities of life. But what I am saying to you right now is like describing to you how a dish would taste. I could tell you all about it but in the end it is you who have to taste it to know what it actually taste like. Similarly, Truth can be learned. But it must be experienced through meditation in order to truly know what it actually is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, learning the truth of life is enjoyable in and of itself. Think of it as learning how to ride a horse. When you don’t know how, it is difficult and stressful to try to steer it. But once you come to learn about the nature of the horse and how to ride it, it is much easier and much more enjoyable. Life is very much the same. The more I became aware of the Truth of life the easier and happier life becomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You either live life or the life will live you, one way or the other.&lt;/strong&gt; And the only difference is how much can  we come to know life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What meditation has given me is unrequitable and invaluable. There is too much that meditation has given me to all be written in words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have spoken to you about what I have received through meditation. But just as a final note, &lt;strong&gt;meditation is not something anyone should expect to gain anything out of.&lt;/strong&gt; The expectation and desire of meditation will make it impossible to succeed in any attempt to meditate. Even though meditation leads you to True Happiness, but you can’t even expect or demand it to make you happy. Meditation is just to be mindful of ourselves. Just that is enough to get us to True Happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, I am not here to prove to you why you should meditate. &lt;strong&gt;Meditation does not need convincing as much as it needs to be proven.&lt;/strong&gt; Thus, the only way to find out if what I have told you is true or if meditation can really give you True Happiness is to give it a try. Let meditation speaks its own truth to you so that you can see for yourself what meditation is and what it is for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I can only point you toward the door. But you have to walk through it yourself.&quot; - Buddha&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Why Meditate?</title>
        <dc:creator>Supakorn Laohasongkram</dc:creator>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There are 3 goals in meditation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		To see the true nature of ourselves and the world
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		To experience peace and happiness
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		To become skillful at handling our own desires
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meditation allows us to experience a state of stillness. When the mind is not looking for something it wants and is not concern about its dislike, our mind comes together to produce an experience of True Happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be careful though that the practice of mindfulness is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; about not thinking or ignoring or denying the reality of our undesirable thoughts and feelings. Mindfulness is simply to be mindful. All thoughts, feeling and everything that comes to our senses are &lt;em&gt;allowed.&lt;/em&gt; The practice of mindfulness is not a judgment on ourselves. It is not a self-management exercise in which we must assert control over ourselves. It is a practice of knowing and being mindful of life as it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more we come to know the nature of ourselves the more we will realize the three noble Truths of our lives which are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everything-ourselves, our feelings, our attitude, our body, or the world-is impermanent.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Nothing lasted.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Reality has nothing to do with what we want. (&lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/07/no-room-for-desire-in-life/&quot;&gt;For a more detailed explanation, click here.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How could the heart be unhappy if it knows everything is impermanent? How could the heart be unhappy if it knows everything will not last forever? How could our heart be unhappy if it knows that reality is not about what we want but about the absolute law of cause and effect that determined reality? It can&#39;t be unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the Truth that our hearts will come to know through meditation. It is not about knowing it intellectually. We can know that everything is impermanent in our thought but does our hearts truly accept and understand that Truth? When someone we love passes away, regardless of how many books we read about impermanent, it is only the heart that decides our happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, &lt;strong&gt;we need to meditate in order to let our heart see the Truth for itself.&lt;/strong&gt; It&#39;s not an intellectual discovery to be found in books or in logic. It&#39;s a spiritual discovery which comes from and by the heart that see the Truth of life.&lt;/p&gt;
