        <title>Why Meditate?</title>
        <dc:creator>Supakorn Laohasongkram</dc:creator>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There are 3 goals in meditation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		To see the true nature of ourselves and the world
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		To experience peace and happiness
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		To become skillful at handling our own desires
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meditation allows us to experience a state of stillness. When our mind is not looking for something it wants or not concern about what its dislike, our mind comes together to produce an experience of True Happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be careful that the practice of mindfulness is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; about not thinking or ignoring or denying the reality of our undesirable thoughts and feelings. Mindfulness is simply to be mindful of everything. All thoughts, feeling and everything that comes to our senses are &lt;em&gt;allowed.&lt;/em&gt; The practice of mindfulness is not a judgment on ourselves. It is not a self-management exercise in which we must assert control over ourselves. It is a practice of knowing and being mindful of everything as it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more we come to know the nature of ourselves the more we will realize the three noble Truths of our lives which are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everything-ourselves, our feelings, our attitude, our body, or the world-is impermanent.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Nothing lasted.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Reality has nothing to do with what we want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How could the heart be unhappy if it knows everything is impermanent? How could the heart be unhappy if it knows everything will not last forever? How could our heart be unhappy if it knows that reality is not about what we want but about the absolute law of cause and effect that determined reality?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can&#39;t be unhappy. Its only attitude toward life is that of True Happiness. We can only accept and be humble at the presence of the reality, in good or in bad, in happiness or despair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the Truth that your heart will come to know through meditation. It is not about knowing it intellectually. You can know that everything is impermanent in your thought but does your heart truly accept and understand that Truth? When someone we love pass away, regardless of how many books you read about impermanent, it is only the heart that decides our happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, &lt;strong&gt;we need to meditate in order to let our heart see the Truth for itself.&lt;/strong&gt; It&#39;s not an intellectual discovery to be found in books or in logic. It&#39;s a spiritual discovery which comes from and by the heart  that see the Truth of life.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cause of Unhappiness Part Four: Mistake in Life</title>
        <dc:creator>Supakorn Laohasongkram</dc:creator>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;You can&#39;t change or erase what happened in the past, all you can change is your attitude toward it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mistake in life is not to be taken lightly. For some, one mistake could define who they are and enslaves our lives in an unending quest to redeem or fix the mistake that we have done in the past. So let’s first begin by understanding what mistake is and how it effects our happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Understanding the Nature of Life Mistake&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Mistake is like a ghost.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we do not reconcile or do not know how to reconcile with our mistake, the mistake becomes an open loop which endlessly haunts our lives. The more we wish to not think about our mistake, the more our minds irresistibly wander back to the mistake to relive it over and over again. Even though it might have happened years ago, or you might be at work or in the middle of a party, our mistake will not rest or give us a break. It will continue to enter into our conscious mind to remind us of its presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worse, we even welcome it in our lives by letting the mistake take over us. This is similar to when you are sad and want to listen to a sad song just to make life sadder. We feel it is not enough for us to feel the pain of the mistake, so we begin rubbing the salt in the wound just so the pain can seep a little deeper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. The mistake itself is not what makes us unhappy. It’s our attitude towards it that makes us unhappy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mistake is fueled by our biases toward it. The more we resist, avoid, hide, deny, blame others, bend, or twist the reality of our mistake the more powerful it becomes in our lives. It draws power from our hate toward it. It draws power from our inability accept or come to term with it. It draws power from our feeling of guilt, depression, anger, frustration, self-hating, and embarrassment. All of which originate from our desire that the past should or should not have been otherwise. It’s the void in our want from reality which could never be changed. The only way for a mistake to lose its power is for us to allow our mistake to be, without disliking it or denying its reality. This is how a mistake loses its power and slowly fade away from our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Mistake is by default inevitable.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody wants to make mistake. Yet, why do we make mistake? Nobody would make a mistake if they know ahead of time what would be the consequence of that action. &lt;em&gt;But the point here is we don’t.&lt;/em&gt; That is why we must make mistake. There is no avoiding it. So when we look back at our mistake in life especially ones that our minds often replay in our heads, it is important to understand that there was nothing for us to change the past. It is something that must happen the way it did and not any other way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Changing Our Attitude with Our Mistakes in Life&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how does one deal with one’s mistake? Here are 4 definitive steps to overcoming your mistake in life:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Take Full Responsibility for Your Mistake and All Its Ramification&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		If we are unwilling to accept its consequences, then we are not ready to fully come to terms with our mistake. Have the courage to face your mistake. Be responsible for it. Don&#39;t run away from it. Mistake is by definition undesirable. But when we made a mistake, we must be mature enough to take full responsibility for it whether or not it directly or indirectly effects others. 
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Think About What Is Best at This Very Moment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Is there a benefit in going over our mistake? If there is then please do. But if brooding over our mistake only rubs the salt in the wound, then perhaps there is no point in letting our mistake take over our lives. The best question to ask in this situation is, &quot;What can we control at this moment?&quot; Can we change the past? No. Can we change what is in the now? Yes. So why not focus on what we can change instead of what we can&#39;t? Why not ask important questions like, &quot;How can I do my best now so that I can avoid more mistake in the future?&quot; or &quot;What is the best thing to do right now?&quot; So without the burden of the past, &lt;strong&gt;move on by letting go of the past which you no longer have control and focus on what you can control in the present moment.&lt;/strong&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Learn to Forgive Ourselves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		It&#39;s impossible to move on if we do not forgive ourselves from our mistake. The characteristic of mistake in life is that they inevitable. Thus, it must happen the way it did. Looking back, you would never have done it. But because you did not know. That&#39;s why you made that mistake. So don&#39;t take it personally. Anyone who was in your shoes would have made the same mistake. 
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Accepting Our Mistake as It Is. Do not Avoid, Hide, Deny, Blame Others, Bend, or Twist the Reality of Our Mistake.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
		If you can&#39;t openly tell others your mistake, then this is a good indicator that there is something you still cannot accept about it. Of course, I am &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; suggesting for us to go out and tell everybody of our mistake either. My point is simply to come to understand ourselves if we still have our biases toward our mistake. If we still do then it is a good time to reconcile ourselves with these mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Learning to Be with Your Mistake&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to reconcile with any mistakes in life is to accept it. Accepting is different from justifying our wrong doing. Accepting our mistake is to understand that there is no way of going back to fix the past of what we have done. Accepting our mistake is to be courageous and mature enough to accept whatever outcome and ramification that come as the direct or indirect results of our mistake. Accepting is to see no value in brooding or regreting our mistake, but intead see the value in what is in front of us. It is to be in the now by taking in the mistake as is, not as what you hope or do not hope it would be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a basic practice, when the mind wanders back to your mistake in life. Do not fight it. Do not find excuses for yourself about why you were not wrong. Observe the feelings associated with our mistakes, but do not let it overwhelm or take control of our lives. Do not hope the mistake would happen otherwise. Simply, know it and be mindful of it. Take it as it is. And understand that it must happen the way it did. Remind yourself of what is the best thing to do right now by knowing what you can and what you can’t control at this very moment. And let go of our feelings by seeing how the bad feelings that comes with your mistake does not help you or anyone to be better. Eventually, your mistake will begin to lose its power as you slowly come to see it for what it is. &lt;strong&gt;Don’t let your mistake of the past clouds what is in front you today. Don’t let what you can’t control hinders what you can control.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cause of Unhappiness Part Three: Fear of Being Meaningless</title>
        <dc:creator>Supakorn Laohasongkram</dc:creator>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;
	One of the worst fear of our lives is that we become meaningless. Whether this would be meaningless to oneself, meaningless to others, or meaningless to the world. Meaninglessness comes in various forms. The feeling of being useless, most evident in today society where everything is about productivity, to a feeling of inadequency. At True Happiness, this is an important concept to understand as often times, we, humans, equate our self-worth with our meaning. So let&#39;s dig a little deeper on this subject of meaninglessness to see where we could find True Happiness in this.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- 
&lt;p&gt;
	Meaning emernate from the function of difference. What I mean by that is meaning is only possible by comparing two things. The meaning of something is emernate from what it is not. How
&lt;/p&gt; --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://true-happiness.github.io/img/stick.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most reowned Theravada Buddhist Monk in Thailand, &quot;Ajahn Chah,&quot; once asked his disciples if a wooden stick--just like the one in the picture above--is long or short. Some answered, &quot;It is long.&quot; Some answered, &quot;It is short.&quot; But Ajahn Chah&#39;s answer was not what one would unexpected. His answer is that the stick is neither long nor short. It is only long if we want it to be short. And it is short only if you want it to be long. Thus, the wooden stick is neither short or long. It is what it is. Only our want make it so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, our life is the same as that wooden stick. &lt;strong&gt;We are as meaningless as how much meaningful we want to be.&lt;/strong&gt; A rich person who want to be richer always feels he or she is not meaningful enough. So in a sense, he is &quot;poor.&quot; A poor person who feels that he or she has all that he or she ever wants is in way &quot;rich.&quot; It all depends on your want. If you want to be richer then immediately you are &quot;poor.&quot; If you feel you already have more than you want then at that very moment you are &quot;rich.&quot;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We are as meaningless as how much meaningful we want to be.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moment you want to be more meaningful is the moment that you have become meaningless. Those who feels they are already meaningful has no need to search for more meaning in their life. They are already happy and satisfied with life. They have finished looking for more meaning to fill the void of their meaninglessness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, to find true happiness is not to look for more meaning, but to stop looking for one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;What to take away&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	We are as meaningless as how much meaningful we want to be. Thus, to find true happiness is not to look for meaning, but to stop looking for one.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- 
&lt;p&gt;Life, in essense, is incomparable to one another. Life is just is. You can compare all you want but at the end of the day how could you ever compare something so different to one another? So live and let live.&lt;/p&gt;

We are as meaningless as we want to be. 


&lt;p&gt;meaning = self-worth&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have studied Philosophy espeically on the topic of epistemology or the study of how we know what we know then you will know that meaning emernate from a function of difference. What I mean by that is &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what I am going to tell you. First, it&#39;s ok to be meaningless.(decontructivist) Second, you are not meaningless.(constructivist)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are looking for a meaningful life, but to truly live is not to look for one.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you want to be meaningful, then you need to have what it takes to be meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://seattleinsight.org/Talks/BrowseTalks/DharmaTalk/tabid/90/TalkID/375/Default.aspx&quot;&gt;recommended talks&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;p&gt; 
	Let&#39;s face it. I believe we are all born with the fear of being meaningless. We are so fearful that we will not have any meaning that we live our lives trying to add meaning to ourselves. We buy things we do not need to help boost our ego. We want to get that degrees so that we look better than our friends. We want to get that job so that we feel better about ourselves. Why? because we feel we still do not have enough.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It takes so little, so infinitely little, for someone to find himself on the other side of the border, where everything - love, convictions, faith, history - no longer has meaning. The whole mystery of human life resides on the fact that it is spent in the immediate proximity of, and even in direct contact with, that border, that it is separated from it not by kilometers but by barely a millimeter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Milan Kundera, The Book of Laughter and Forgetting&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This fear of being meaningless has been with us since we were born and it is at the core of our existence.

	We can&#39;t even rest anymore since it is tied to a sense of meaninglessness. We can&#39;t even not have a salary. How much salary we make become how meaningful we are.

	But is being meaningful or useful in life
&lt;/p&gt;


So why do we not want to be meaningless? What&#39;s wrong with being meaningless? I believe that the answer to this question is the fact that we were born with nothing to begin with.

So why do we fear meaninglessness?
How does meaningless cause us unhappiness?


&lt;p&gt;
	But we are born with nothing, and we will die with nothing. So actually whatever a little we have right now is already a plus. It is a gift just to be alive. It is a gift to be born healthy. Thus, it is not correct to assume that we are meaningless.

	It&#39;s ok to be meaningless. We were all born from being zero. 

	There are probably millions of infant motality  We have nothing to begin with. Why are we crying over something which is even already even better than when we are born. Many infants today die even before they get a chance to live. Why are we crying over our the bad luck despite being so lucky to live up until now?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	Meaning is, therefore, relative. Let&#39;s say you feel you are not rich enough. And you are unhappy about it. 

	Meaning is created by comparing one thing with another. It simply the difference between one thing and another. Meaning does not emernate from the thing itself. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Science of Happiness</title>
        <dc:creator>Supakorn Laohasongkram</dc:creator>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If I know water would boil at a 100 degrees Celsius. Do I need to hope it would boil at 100 degree Celsius? Or even if I do not want the water to be boiled, could I desire the water not to be boiled even if I heat it up to 100 degrees Celsius?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I can hope, dance, or pray—or do all three at once—for it to rain tomorrow. However, if the causes are not right, it will not rain. Or maybe I do not want it to rain tomorrow. But again, if the conditions are right for it rain, it will rain regardless of what I want or do not want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simple yet elegant wisdom that I am attempting to reiterate here is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Reality has nothing to do with what one wants. Instead, reality has everything to do with the law of cause and effect.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the causes are right for an effect to occur, it will occur regardless of what one wants or do not want. Scientifically speaking, there is no room for desires in reality. There is only cause and effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The common way, we, humans, achieve happiness in life is to put what we desire in front of the causes we must perform to achieve the result. We start a project by wanting it to be finished. We run a business by only wanting to gain and never to lose. We begin living by being afraid of dying. Even when we are deeply in love with someone, we can&#39;t help ourselves feeling a little insecure about how long the good time will last. Humans always put our desire in front of what the reality is. For this reason, we have become constantly fearful, worried, impatient, and frustrated by what we demand from reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One does not need desire in life to achieve whatever he or she wants. Because it doesn&#39;t matter how much you want something, what matters is whether or not there is enough causes for the the effect to occur. Our duty is to the law of cause and effect, not to what you want from reality. By creating the right causes, you can attain anything in life &lt;em&gt;with or without&lt;/em&gt; the need to desire for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only difference between these two wanting and not wanting is the difference between being the happiest man alive or being miserable. There are two ways of achieving anything in life. One is to put your desire in front of what the reality is. In this case, happiness is therefore fleeting by away where but now. He can never be happy until his goal and desire is fulfilled. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second way is to work toward your goal without the need to get ahead of ourselves. In other words, to work with and according to what the reality is, not work for what you want from reality. The man whose desire is with reality is always satisfied with what is. Since his desire is in tune with reality, he is not anxious or worry. This, in turn, allows him to become more composed, relaxed, and ultimately more productive while working toward his goal with a peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I am explaining here is best summarized by Epictetus as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Do not seek to have events happen as you want them to, but instead want them to happen as they do happen, and your life will go well.&lt;br /&gt;-Epictetus&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When someone—like me—is applying for graduate school I might, right away, desires to be accepted. But who am I to want or not want things from reality without ever creating the right causes for it to happen? In reality, whether or not anyone would or would not be accepted has many different factors—many beyond one’s control. So just by applying or having a great supporting resume doesn’t mean I have the right or the claim or demand from reality my admission. So why desire? Why worry? Why put my desire ahead of the reality? And why not channel this energy, instead, at creating the right causes, which are writing the best application?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, the message here is simple: life is happier, better, and more satisfactory if one lives in accordance with reality and its law rather than living in accordance with what one wants from reality. Reality does not revolves around what one wants from it; it revolves around the absolute law of cause and effect. Thus, life is never like what one wants it to be. The only way for anyone to feel the unsatisfactoriness of life is to be unmindful of the law of conditionality and desire life or reality to be the way one wants. So let’s keep our feet on the ground; and stay with reality and its law. Never forget that the way to live happily, correctly, and more efficiently, is not to put our desires in front of our action, but the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;What to take away&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
	Life doesn&#39;t revolve around what we desire from reality because reality revolves around the absolute law of cause and effect. So forget about all your fantasies about how reality should be. Instead, focus on, be satisfied, and accept what is. Begin living in the now! And keep on working with reality by making the right causes to achieve the right effect. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>The Six Greatest Gifts You Can Give Your Loved Ones</title>
        <dc:creator>Supakorn Laohasongkram</dc:creator>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;So if we love someone, we should train in being able to listen. By listening with calm and understanding, we can ease the suffering of another person.&amp;#8221; &lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8211; Thich Nhat Hanh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s Christmastime and it&amp;#8217;s the season of giving &amp;#8230; what are you giving your loved ones this year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The holidays often mean giving a lot of gifts, sometimes expensive, but often we lose sight of what&amp;#8217;s most important.&lt;span id=&quot;more-2072&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What gifts do your loved ones really want, whether they&amp;#8217;re your children, your significant other, your parents, your friends, or other family members? Is it an expensive electronic item, or some other material or tangible item? Perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the gifts I list below are more important. Sure, they might not be as fun to open on Christmas morning (or whatever other holiday you might celebrate), but in the long run, they&amp;#8217;ll value these gifts more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Your Presence&lt;/strong&gt;. This means making it a priority to spend time with them &amp;#8212; if they are truly important, you can make the time. You might have to change things in your life to make the time, but it&amp;#8217;s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond just making the time, though, you have to actually be present when you spend time with loved ones. That means learning to stay in the moment, rather than having your mind on other things, checking your iPhone or Blackberry every two minutes, or trying to take care of other tasks and chores while spending time with them. Instead, drop everything else and focus on being there with your loved ones &amp;#8212; really listen, really have fun, really be present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Your Love&lt;/strong&gt;. This is perhaps an obvious one on the list, but it&amp;#8217;s too important to gloss over. It&amp;#8217;s imperative that you tell your loved ones that &amp;#8230; well, that you love them. Regularly. But just as important is that you actually show them you love them, in your actions every day, throughout the day. Hugs, intimacy, smiles, doing kind things for them, considering their needs and feelings &amp;#8230; just little things that mean a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Your Compassion&lt;/strong&gt;. How is this different than giving the gift of your love? Well, it&amp;#8217;s possible to love someone and not show compassion. For example, we parents often discipline our children and love them at the same time &amp;#8230; but often compassion is even more important than discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compassion is finding empathy with your loved one &amp;#8230; trying to see things from their eyes, trying to understand what they&amp;#8217;re going through &amp;#8230; and then doing your best to be kind and to end their suffering and to make them happier. &lt;a href=&quot;http://zenhabits.net/2007/06/a-guide-to-cultivating-compassion-in-your-life-with-7-practices/&quot;&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. A Voice&lt;/strong&gt;. We can give so much just by paying attention to a loved one, and really listening, and showing that we&amp;#8217;re interested in what they have to say, and showing that what they say is important and respected. Too often our children or spouse might talk to us but are only met with a disinterested nod or other small acknowledgment, or we&amp;#8217;ll make light or fun of what they say, as if it&amp;#8217;s not important. But giving a person a voice, and showing that their words matter, will have a long-lasting different in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. A Healthy Lifestyle&lt;/strong&gt;. When you spend time with your loved one, try to do so while enjoying a healthy and fun activity, such as going on a hike, playing a sport, tossing around a Frisbee, going for a walk or jog, doing some yardwork, and so on. When you get together to eat, try to eat healthy foods. Make the habits of good health a part of your lifestyle, and encourage your loved ones to do the same &amp;#8212; it could save their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Your Belief in Them&lt;/strong&gt;. Simply believing in another person, and showing that in your words and in your deeds, can make a huge difference. Studies of people who grew up in dysfunctional homes but who grew up to be happy and successful show that the one thing they had in common was a significant adult who believed in them. Do this for your child, and for the adult loved ones in your life as well. Support their dreams and passions and hobbies. Participate with them. Be nothing but encouraging. Be their greatest cheerleader. Whether they actually accomplish these dreams or not, your belief is of unlimited importance to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Love and compassion are necessities, not luxuries. Without them, humanity cannot survive.&amp;#8221; &lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8211; the Dalai Lama&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Cause of Unhappiness Part Two: Comparing Yourself to Others</title>
        <dc:creator>Supakorn Laohasongkram</dc:creator>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Human&#39;s innate ability to compare ourselves to others is perhaps the root of all sins in life. Knowing that I am better create a sense of pride or even arrogant, while knowing that I am less create a sense of jealousy toward the other. There is no ends to our comparison unless we stop to put any value into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I mean by &quot;no ends&quot; is this. Let&#39;s say that I want to be better than others. Once I meet someone who is worse of than I am then I become happy because I feel am better. But in reality, there is always someone who is better than you. So there is no ends to this quest of wanting to be better than other people. There is simply no happiness to be found in such unwholesome desire of trying to look better than other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did I know this? Well, because I used to be that kind of person. I used to enjoy being better than others. Every conservation I start, every word I speak leak a sense of pride and the desperate need to show off myself. If one does not see oneself objectively. It is most likely that this habit will never change. And that person would forever carry around this inferiority complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my happiness was to look better than others, I couldn&#39;t see how tiresome it was for me as well as those around me to put up with my own complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the more I reflect upon this &quot;happiness&quot; I gain from being seen as better than others, the more I see its negative effects. First of all, it is tiresome to try to talk about how great you are in every context. And second, it is rather obnoxious for others who have to put up with my own insecurity. No one likes someone who fill up the conversation only boasting about himself. I simply can&#39;t be happy since my happiness is fleeting. I needed someone to be better than at all time else I wouldn&#39;t be happy. When I feel like I am better than a person, I become happy. When that person or someone else become better than me then I become unsatisfied. It&#39;s the kind of happiness which is dependent upon whether or not the context allow me to feel as if I am &quot;better&quot; than others. What I eventually realise is that it is too hard to find happiness. My happiness to look better didn&#39;t do anyone including myself any good except fulfilling the unfulfillable desire to look &quot;better&quot;. Thus, I quit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;How to Stop Comparing Yourself to Others&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Compare yourself today with yourself yesterday&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Knowing that that there is no ends to comparing yourself to others. You will never be satisfied. Because you satisfaction is relative to how others are.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Better could mean worse and less is sometimes more. It all depends on which standard or perspective are you putting yourself against&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Seeing the negative effect it has on oneself and everyone around you.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Reflect. Reflect. Reflect. As long as you are biased toward yourself and your ways of attaining happiness, you will not find true happiness. Thus, it is necessary to reflect often. Question yourself. Why I am still unhappy? And if possible, learn to be mindfulness of your actions to see whether they are driven by this unwholesome desire or the desire to prove yourself something. Know thyself and change yourself before it&#39;s too late!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Cause of Unhappiness Part One: Misplacing Your Happiness</title>
        <dc:creator>Supakorn Laohasongkram</dc:creator>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Happiness is like a string which ties us to that which we believe is our happiness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s say for example that if you tie your happiness with being rich and accepted, then as long as you are not rich or accepted you can not be happy. Similarly if you rest your happiness on your promotion then the promotion itself becomes the happiness which you have put outside of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We, humans, have many things which our happiness is dependent upon whether it would be our wealth, health, or love ones. So imagine yourself being ties to millions of these strings of &amp;ldquo;happiness&amp;rdquo; and what you soon realise is that &amp;ldquo;happiness&amp;rdquo; becomes a binding spider web which you are the prey. Each &quot;happiness&quot; is pulling us left and right to the point that it become impossible to attain any happiness or freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So be careful where you place your happiness because that which you believe to be &amp;ldquo;happiness&amp;rdquo; will be your master and you will be its slave. The happiest man on earth does not rest his &amp;ldquo;happiness&amp;rdquo; on anything. He is already happiness as is. He is even happy with the unhappy things in life because he knows how to accept and move on. For us who are new this journey, so start small by critically examine our happiness. Simplify your life and cut those unnessarily ties of &amp;ldquo;happiness&amp;rdquo;. Is it all that important to be &amp;ldquo;succesful&amp;rdquo; in eyes of the others? Is being rich the answer to life? Is it worth it to trade your inner happiness for an outer one? Is my family comes first before my work? Slowly find out what matters to you most. Cut out any unnecessary wants. Eventually your life will feel lighter as you let go of those extraneous ties of &quot;happiness.&quot;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Question Your Happiness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a practice, I suggest you to regularly review your life. I personally have a habit of writing a journal every night before going to bed to see what is bothering my mind. List them all out, question this list of what you called &amp;ldquo;happiness&amp;rdquo; then sort only ones that matters most to you. You will easily find many things which you desire; yet they are unnecessary towards life and are, in some ways, even weighting you down from achieving what really matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happiness needs work. So invest some time to learn more about what you really want. Tell me what you find out in the comments below so that we can all help one another. We are learning to be happy so enjoy your road toward it. Have fun learning it. I promise you it&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;What to take away&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing where your happiness truly belongs is a skill one which can be improve by learning to quickly identify where you have misplaced your happiness, and letting go of unnecessary desire. The less ties of &quot;happiness&quot; you have the better you easier and happier your life will be.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Empty Handed Full Hearted</title>
        <dc:creator>Supakorn Laohasongkram</dc:creator>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We often load ourselves up when we travel, because we want to be prepared for various situations. This burden of being prepared leaves us with our arms full, unable to receive whatever is there when we arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It leaves us tired from carrying, so that we are not happy when we meet someone new on our travels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we traveled with empty hands, ready to embrace new experiences, receive new foods, touch new people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We might feel less prepared when we leave, but the preparedness is an illusion. Stuff doesn&amp;#8217;t make us prepared. Having empty hands but a heart that is full of love leaves us prepared for anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn&amp;#8217;t just apply to taking a trip, but to living each day. Each day is a journey, and we load ourselves up with material possessions, with tasks and projects, with things to read and write, with meetings and calls and texts. Our hands are full, not ready for anything new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drop everything, be &lt;a href=&quot;http://zenhabits.net/embrace-chaos/&quot;&gt;open to everything&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter each day empty-handed, and full-hearted.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Simplify</title>
        <dc:creator>Supakorn Laohasongkram</dc:creator>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8216;In proportion as he simplifies his life, the laws of the universe will appear less complex, and solitude will not be solitude, nor poverty poverty, nor weakness weakness.&amp;#8217; &lt;strong&gt;~Henry David Thoreau&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tendency of life in our society is to become more complicated: Internet, television, shopping, work, family commitments, possessions, eating, debt &amp;#8230; these things pile on top of each other endlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a rather bad formula, as our days have a limited capacity, and so do we as humans. We can only do so much, only handle so many tasks and possessions and social commitments, and filling ourselves to those limits means we stress our breaking points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes a bit of conscious effort to simplify, but it&amp;#8217;s one of the greatest things I&amp;#8217;ve ever learned to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simplify everything. That might sound hard, but with practice it&amp;#8217;s actually fairly easy, and leads to a quiet, content, lovely life full of space, with only the things in it that matter to me: my family, my writing, with some reading and workouts thrown in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you simplify? As simply as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Block off some disconnected time&lt;/strong&gt;. The Internet is amazing, but always being connected means you&amp;#8217;re always pulled in a thousand directions at once. It&amp;#8217;s hard to focus, hard to connect with others, hard to get out into nature and be active. So schedule some time every day for disconnection: maybe a block in the morning where you get your best work done, and a block in the afternoon when you get out and active, or connect with friends or family.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start eliminating commitments&lt;/strong&gt;. List your commitments, and pick one to eliminate today. It&amp;#8217;s a simple matter of making a call or sending an email explaining that you can&amp;#8217;t do the commitment. Trust me, they&amp;#8217;ll find a way to live without you. You&amp;#8217;ll start to free up time for what&amp;#8217;s more important to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start purging possessions&lt;/strong&gt;. Every day, find 5 things to donate or give to friends. Or clear an entire shelf or countertop, leaving only the things you actually use, getting rid of the rest. Slowly your possessions will be simplified to just the essentials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ban shopping for 30 days&lt;/strong&gt;. You can do this. Don&amp;#8217;t buy anything except the essentials (food, toiletries, basic supplies). If you think you really need it, put it on a list to be evaluated after the 30 days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wash your bowl&lt;/strong&gt;. When you&amp;#8217;re done eating, mindfully wash your bowl. When you&amp;#8217;re done with anything, get in the habit of pausing before moving onto the next thing, and cleaning up after yourself. Put your food away. Put your clothes where they belong. Put your keys in one spot. Clean the sink before you leave it. This simple habit will keep you mindful while saving you lots of cleanup later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schedule time for what&amp;#8217;s important&lt;/strong&gt;. What&amp;#8217;s most important to you? Your spouse or kids? Creating? Reading novels? Cooking, gardening, crafts, carpentry? Make the time for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get outdoors once a day&lt;/strong&gt;. Too often we are stuck at a desk or on the couch. Get outside, take a walk, enjoy the fresh air and sunshine. Go for a hike or a run with a friend. Play some sports. Run around and play tag with your kids. These simple activities will change your life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat some plants&lt;/strong&gt;. Learn some simple recipes that incorporate super healthy foods you might not be eating: kale, spinach, broccoli, quinoa, berries, flaxseeds, lentils, avocados, black beans, squash, raw almonds and walnuts, garlic, turmeric, cayenne, cinnamon. These simple plants will make you strong like oxen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drink tea&lt;/strong&gt;. Green tea brewed from relatively fresh whole tea leaves is calming, healthy, and wonderful. A daily tea ritual keeps you grounded and mindful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>The Secret Habit to Success</title>
        <dc:creator>Supakorn Laohasongkram</dc:creator>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In Og Mandino&amp;#8217;s self-help classic, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/055327757X?ie=UTF8&amp;#038;tag=zenhab-20&amp;#038;linkCode=as2&amp;#038;camp=1789&amp;#038;creative=9325&amp;#038;creativeASIN=055327757X&quot;&gt;The Greatest Salesman in the World&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=zenhab-20&amp;#038;l=as2&amp;#038;o=1&amp;#038;a=055327757X&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt;, one of his more powerful concepts is how to form good habits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will form good habits and become their slave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will read each scroll for thirty days in this prescribed manner, before I proceed to the next scroll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I will read the words in silence when I arise. Then, I will read the words in silence after I have partaken of my midday meal. Last, I will read the words again just before I retire at day&amp;#8217;s end, and most important, on this occasion I will read the words aloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the next day I will repeat this procedure, and I will continue in like manner for thirty days. Then, I will turn to the next scroll and repeat this procedure for another thirty days. I will continue in this manner until I have lived with each scroll for thirty days and my reading has become habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So basically, the habit is to read from the 10 Scrolls for 30 days each, morning, noon and night &amp;#8212; but the challenging part is holding back so you only do one scroll per month. &lt;strong&gt;And the first month, you focus on the process of forming those good habits.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you draw from that powerful concept, and start by first teaching yourself how to form a habit, and then focus on one habit for each of the following months, you will be more successful with each habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So here&amp;#8217;s the secret: for the first month&amp;#8217;s habit, you need to develop the discipline of reading a mantra morning, noon and night &amp;#8211; the First Habit.&lt;/strong&gt; It can be a mantra you write yourself, or one that I suggest below. If you can stick to that habit for a month, you can build on that success and start with a second habit &amp;#8212; staying with another small one is best. Each month, you can work on a new habit, focusing on only one per month. But the key is to have the patience to work on only that First Habit for the first month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us have a bunch of habits we&amp;#8217;d like to instill in our daily routine &amp;#8212; from eating healthy, to exercise, reading, writing, waking early, organization, frugality and more &amp;#8212; and it&amp;#8217;s hard not to try to conquer them all at once. But if you can do this, and hold off on those habits until you&amp;#8217;ve accomplished this one, &lt;strong&gt;you&amp;#8217;ll have a much, much greater chance of success at all of them&lt;/strong&gt;. Having the patience to do this won&amp;#8217;t be easy, but remember: you have your entire life ahead of you. If you follow this program, and you&amp;#8217;re successful, you&amp;#8217;ll have eight more habits developed by the end of this year (starting with your next habit in May), and 12 more the next year, and so on. It&amp;#8217;s worth the wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you implement this First Habit? Here&amp;#8217;s the plan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commit Thyself.&lt;/strong&gt; Commit to doing this First Habit for the rest of this month (or if you&amp;#8217;re starting late, do it for 30 days).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morning Habit.&lt;/strong&gt; Every morning, when you wake up, silently read this mantra (borrowed in part from reader &lt;a href=&quot;http://gitmo2007.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Ann M.&lt;/a&gt;, and in part from Og Mandino): &amp;#8220;Today, I start a new life. Today, I create a new, positive habit. The only difference between those who have failed and those who have succeeded lies in the difference of their habits. Good habits are the key to all success. Thus, the first law I will obey is: I will form good habits and become their slave. Today, I take control of my actions and behaviors. With these, I create my life and destiny.&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Midday Habit.&lt;/strong&gt; Every day after you eat lunch, silently read the above mantra.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evening Habit.&lt;/strong&gt; Every evening, just before you go to bed, read the above mantra out loud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracking Habit.&lt;/strong&gt; Create a chart or log, and each day give yourself a checkmark, gold star, or other such mark so that you can see that you&amp;#8217;ve done the habit every single day. Don&amp;#8217;t miss a day, no matter what &amp;#8212; if you can do it every day, without fail, you will have create a 3x-a-day habit that you can use to build upon for your next habit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Habits.&lt;/strong&gt; Make a list of what habits you&amp;#8217;d like to work on each month, once you&amp;#8217;ve successfully completed the First Habit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motivation Hacks.&lt;/strong&gt; If possible, use as many of the Top 20 Motivation hacks to help you stick to your habit for the rest of the month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celebration Time!&lt;/strong&gt; Celebrate your successes along the way, and celebrate when you&amp;#8217;re done!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resolve yourself to this First Habit, and you&amp;#8217;ll be inspired by your own success. From Og Mandino:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And I make a solemn oath to myself that nothing will retard my new life&amp;#8217;s growth. I will lose not a day from these readings for that day cannot be retrieved nor can I substitute another for it. I must not , I will not, break this habit of daily reading from these scrolls and, in truth, the few moments spent each day on this new habit are but a small price to pay for the happiness and success that will be mine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So here&amp;#8217;s your challenge: Commit to doing this First Habit, morning noon and night, for a month.&lt;/strong&gt; That simple. Then you can move on to other habits, once this one is established.&lt;/p&gt;
