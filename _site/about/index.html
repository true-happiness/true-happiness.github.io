			<!-- <h2 class="section-heading">Why True Happiness?</h2> -->

<!-- <p>In the world where success has become more important than happiness, it is only natural that we, human, have become unhappy. Knowing that there is a better way out of this social trap, I would like to share my passion of learning to be happiness with you so that you can contin</p> -->


<h2 class="section-heading">My Story</h2>

<p>My name is Supakorn Laohasongkram. I was born in Bangkok, Thailand. I am <span id="my_age"></span> years old. Learning about how to become a better and happier person is my passion. Ever since college, I have always want to know is what life is all about, how to rightly live, and what is the solution for making the world a better place.</p>

<p>In my search to answer these questions in life, I began studying Philosophy. I traveled, backpacked, and lived in India, France, Japan and many other countries around the world. After college, I even ordained as a Theravada Buddhist monk for one full year to experience the simplicity of happiness and explore what is life all about.</p>

<p>Six years after ceaselessly searching, I have finally found the answer which satisfied my questions to life. And the answer is happiness.</p>

<p>Happiness is important to each one of us. But it is also has a crucial in its role in defining our society. If happiness is to "take" rather than to "give" then there is no question why there is a huge disparity, inequality, and injustice in this world. Thus, happiness must can can be developed. So that not only will we be happier in our lives but at the same time make this world a better place.</p>

<!-- <p>And so, I have taken a leap of faith and decided to dedicate my life to this goal by starting this blog despite the fact that I am running on negative income. My friends said I am crazy because I can't survive if no one knows who I am. My dad shakes his head and said "It's not possible" because no one will want to listen to someone without a formal qualifaction. My mother's advice seems to be more focused on how to first become famous and well-known rather than focusing on what to me matter most: <strong>helping others</strong>. I have faith that what I do here is truly good. And I believe that as long as my focus and desire is first and foremost to help others, the readers will truly benefit. Everything else will then fall into its place to make my immediate goal of making a living doing what I love a reality. So please help support me, see what I have to offer, and join me in the journey toward true happiness.</p> -->

<h2 class="section-heading">My Commitment</h2>

<p>Over <span id="year_of_practice"></span> years of practicing, I realize how valuable and transformative it is for one to be able to learn about happiness. I have no desire for money, fame or to prove any point. I simply know how to help and want to help. Thus, my commitment is to you. My goal is to help everyone achieve True Happiness. Whether you are seeking for a greater happiness in life or in need of a helping hand. My promise is to be there to support you. This is the <strong>work I cannot not do</strong>. So make use of me. I am available for you 24/7. You may contact me <a href="/contact">here</a>.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">My Vision</h2>
<blockquote>“Educating the mind without educating the heart is no education at all.”
- Aristotle</blockquote>

<p>My vision is to start a university.</p>

<p>Education teaches about the truth and nature of many things from small insects to endlesss universe. But what it neglects to teach the students is about the students themselves. The function of education today is to merely put power in the hands of the students without teaching them how to exercise it. And as a result, we have the world where the fortunates use their fortune to take advantage of those who are less fortunate. Those who received the best education are using their best mind to try to exploit those who might not received education at all. Graduating from top university does not mean he or she will enter the world thinking about how to better it. Theodore Roosevelt once said:</p>

<blockquote>"A man who has never gone to school may steal a freight car; but if he has a university education, he may steal the whole railroad."</blockquote>

<p>Wealth will not stop people from their greed. And giving students more power without teaching them how to exercise will definitely not be a good idea. 




I have written about <a href="/principles_of_happiness/why_true_happiness/">why happiness is the key to world peace</a>. 


What I want is a wholistic education in which students can be passionate about bettering themselves while at the same time 
 </p>


<p>For me, the crux of this issue lies in the fact that education has neglected to teach the student how to find happiness or how to be passionate. What I want is a university where we teach our students how to be happy. We teaches them of different kind of happiness and let them experience for themselves which is better. I want the students to be passionate about learning ways of becoming a better human beings. How to love more and share more. Of course, it should be academically rigorous yet its focus should also be inner growth.</p>

Why teach students who to be happy? Human's knowledge to True Happiness is the key to world peace.  -->
