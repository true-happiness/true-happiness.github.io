			<!-- <h2 class="section-heading">Why True Happiness?</h2> -->

<!-- <p>In the world where success has become more important than happiness, it is only natural that we, human, have become unhappy. Knowing that there is a better way out of this social trap, I would like to share my passion of learning to be happiness with you so that you can contin</p> -->


<h2 class="section-heading">Story</h2>

<p>My name is Supakorn Laohasongkram. I was born in Bangkok, Thailand. I am <span id="my_age"></span> years old. Learning about how to become a better and happier person is my passion. Ever since college, I have always want to know is what life is all about, how to rightly live, and what is the solution for making the world a better place.</p>

<p>In my search to answer these questions in life, I began studying Philosophy. I traveled, backpacked, and lived in India, France, Japan and many other countries around the world. After college, I even ordained as a Theravada Buddhist monk for one full year to experience the simplicity of happiness and explore what is life all about.</p>

<p>Six years after ceaselessly searching, I have finally found the answer which satisfied my questions to life. And the answer is happiness.</p>

<p>Happiness is important to each one of us. But it also has a crucial role in defining our society. If happiness is to "take" rather than to "give" then there is no question why there is a huge disparity, inequality, and injustice in this world. Thus, happiness  can and must be developed. So that not only will we be happier in our lives but at the same time make this world into a better place.</p>

<!-- <p>And so, I have taken a leap of faith and decided to dedicate my life to this goal by starting this blog despite the fact that I am running on negative income. My friends said I am crazy because I can't survive if no one knows who I am. My dad shakes his head and said "It's not possible" because no one will want to listen to someone without a formal qualifaction. My mother's advice seems to be more focused on how to first become famous and well-known rather than focusing on what to me matter most: <strong>helping others</strong>. I have faith that what I do here is truly good. And I believe that as long as my focus and desire is first and foremost to help others, the readers will truly benefit. Everything else will then fall into its place to make my immediate goal of making a living doing what I love a reality. So please help support me, see what I have to offer, and join me in the journey toward true happiness.</p> -->

<h2 class="section-heading">Commitment</h2>

<p>Over <span id="year_of_practice"></span> years of practice, I realize how valuable and transformative it is for one to be able to learn about happiness. I have no desire for money, fame or to prove any point. I simply know how to help and want to help. Thus, my commitment is to your happiness. My goal is to help everyone achieve True Happiness. Whether you are seeking for a greater happiness in life or in need of a helping hand. My promise is to be there to support you. This is the <strong>work I cannot not do</strong>. So make use of me. I am available for you 24/7. Do not hesitate to contact me <a href="/contact">here</a>.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Goal</h2>

<p>My goal for this website is to offer you truth. I am not telling you to believe me. In fact, I am telling you to <em>not</em> believe me. Why? Because what I am giving you is merely the path. But you have to walk it so that you could <strong>see for yourself</strong> if what I say is true and whether or not it actually helps and transforms your happiness and everything around you. That is all.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Approach</h2>

<p>We learn True Happiness like we learn how to swim. The way to truth for True Happiness is not dialogic or is it a quantitative analysis. We do not learn how to swim by debating or arguing about it nor do we take a step outside of our swimming to measure or analyse to learn how to swim.  The only way to learn happiness is put the practice of True Happiness to work and see for yourself its truth.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Vision</h2>
<blockquote>“Educating the mind without educating the heart is no education at all.”
- Aristotle</blockquote>

<p>My vision is to open a university.</p>

<p>Education teaches about the truth and nature of many things from smallest insect to vastness of our universe. Yet, it never teaches about the truth and nature of the students themselves.</p>

<p>The function of education today is merely to put power in the hands of the students without teaching them how to exercise it. As a result, we have opened up the world where the fortunate could use their fortune to take advantage of those who are less fortunate. Those who received the best education today are judged based on his or her ability to perform more than his or her reason or purpose to perform. Thus, graduating from top universities does not mean he or she will enter the world thinking about how to better it. Theodore Roosevelt once said:</p>

<blockquote>"A man who has never gone to school may steal a freight car; but if he has a university education, he may steal the whole railroad."</blockquote>

<p>Wealth will not stop people from their greed. And more power will not stop people from abusing power. Thus, giving students more power without teaching them how to exercise it is definitely not a good idea. What we need is a holistic approach to education where we do not merely ask the question of what and how. But why.</p>

<p>Why do we study at all? Is it for one's personal ends or is it for the betterment of this world? Students ought to build their "why" to this world as much as the "how" to this world. Because without being able to ask the "why" question, students are left astray in the abyss of not knowing why they were born. Why study? Why are we all here in this world? And what is the best way of living life, one that is beneficial for both ourselves and for this world?</p>

<p>By developing the knowledge outside as well as the knowledge inside of ourselves, this university will grow students who are both capable and compassionate. By learning about life, the students will not only be building their character but he or she will also know how to find True Happiness in life, something which school rarely taught. Academically, this university should be rigorous. It will drive its academic performance not by grade or exams but how well it can inspires the student to learn; or in other words, passion.</p>

<blockquote>"Education is the kindling of a flame, not the filling of a vessel." - Socrates</blockquote>

<p>The purpose of education is to help, not to judge or hinder. It's not teaching students how to memorize for exams. It is not to evaluate students through a single golden standardized test.  It is not to judge the students and decides or limits who they are and what they can become. The focus of this school is simply to help the student to learn how to develop both their hearts and their minds. And that is exactly what this university will do.</p>

<p>With the right support and the right people, I truly believe that if this university comes to life, it will be the best university in the world. It would revolutionize the way education is and has been. It will help change and save many lives. Its student will graduate with the passion to serve and have a strong desire to improve themselves not only for themselves but for all.  It will be the driving force which drives the world in the right direction. So if you are interested or want to support this noble cause, do not hesitate to <a href="/contact">contact</a>.</p>
