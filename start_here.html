<h2 class="section-heading">Welcome to True Happiness</h2>

<p>If you are looking for ways to be happier then you are in the right place. This website is my gift to you. Learning about how to become a better and happier person is my passion. Here is what you will receive from True Happiness...</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What True Happiness Will Give You</h2>

<!-- <p>It's not easy today to be happy. Doesn't matter how wealthy, or successful one has become, there is always </p> -->

<ol>
	<li>Happiness</li>
		<p>Regardless of what context of life you are in--happy or sad, good or bad, rich or poor, young or old--the goal of True Happiness is to help your face and transcend these dualities of life to find True Happiness.  What we will learn is not just a textbook kind of happiness but one that you will be able to experience and apply to your daily life.</p>

	<li>Purpose</li>
		<p>What is the point of life? I can't tell you how many times I woke up with this question. And the worst feeling is when I am unable to answer this daunting question. Because when we don't know what we want in life, life just send us right back in the grind and the grey twlight where it's just living day by day without feeling truly alive and happy. We got one shot in this life. Why not do what matters?</p>

	<li>Truth</li>
		<p>Truth and happiness must go hand in hand. The more you know the Truth of life the easier and enjoyable life becomes. Thus, at True Happiness, its approach to find True Happiness is through truth--not blind belief, not wishful thinking, and not even through words. What I mean is that you should not believe me. What you should do is to put what I said into practice and <strong>see for yourself</strong> if it's for you. I do not claim the truth. What I want is to let truth speaks for itself.</p>
		
	<li>World Peace</li>
		<p>If wealth can save the world, why are we no where near world peace despite the fact that our GDP has increased by the thousand folds compare to what it was hundreds years ago? Even if it rains in gold today, what we will have is not world peace. But more likely wars in which people would fight one another to be richer even though they might already be rich. The main problem here is how humanity seeks and defines happiness. If happiness is to "take" rather than to "give" then there is no way humanity will find world peace. Thus, happiness can and must be developed.</p>
</ol>

<!-- <p>These are questions in life which I want to answer if today is my last day on Earth. I would die happy knowing I did what I have to to help others in the best way possible.</p> -->

<!-- <h2 class="section-heading">How to be happy?</h2> -->

<!-- <h2 class="section-heading">The Way to Happiness</h2> -->

<h2 class="section-heading capitalized">To be happy, there are 4 things to know and 1 thing to do...</h2>

<p>Happiness is a science. And the goal of True Happiness is to turn you into a "happiness expert." The laboratory/school in which we will work at is ourselves. In this laboratory, we will work to discovery four Truth of life:

<!-- There are only four questions in which we need to be able to answer to have a grasp of how to attain true happiness in life... -->

<ol>
	<li><a href="/2015/06/01/what_is_happiness/">What is True Happiness?</a></li>
	<li><a href="/2015/06/29/cause_of_happiness/">What are the causes and conditions of happiness?</a></li>
	<li><a href="/2015/07/23/how_of_happiness/">How to attain True Happiness?</a></li>
	<li><a href="/2015/08/24/why_true_happiness/">Why True Happiness matters?</a></li>
</ol>

<p>These are the four main questions this website will help you answer. But knowing the answer from reading is different from knowing the answer from the hearts. This is why it is imperative that we come to know happiness by heart. Consequently, this requires a practice which would allow the heart to see its own truth and that practice is mindfulness.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Mindfulness is The One Way Street Toward True Happiness.</h2>

<p>How? True Happiness can not be found in the search of what is outside of us. It is about what is inside of us.

<blockquote>'What's worse, the falling rain, or your resistance to getting wet?'<br>- Jeff Foster</blockquote>

<p>I love the quote above. Our resistance is basically our unwillingness to accept Truth. Our tendency is to try to control and change reality to fits our want. But can we demand the rain stop? Can we ask the dead to trun back to life? Can we command someone to love and not hate us? Reality has its own rules and laws which is absolute and does not goes according to what one wills. If one do not know how to adapt and change ourselves to live with reality then that is our resistance to Truth. And that is unhappiness.</p>

<p>You can't change what you do not know. This is why mindfulness is the one way street toward True Happiness. There is no surer path. And there is no path more beautiful than this. This path is about self-transformation, compassion, selflessness, understanding, Truth, and ultimately True Happiness.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Putting my life on the line...</h2>

<blockquote>“สพฺพทานํ ธมฺมทานํ ชินาติ”</blockquote>
<p>Above are the words of the Lord Buddha spoken in his mother tongue, Pali Sanskrit. It is pronounced, "Sappa dana Dhamma dana chinati" which means <strong>"The gift of Truth surpasses all gifts."</strong> This quote is what my life is about.</p>

<p>Truth is all that I am offering here. I am not telling you to believe me. I am merely telling you the path and hoping that you try to walk it so that you could see for yourself if it actually helps and transforms your happiness and everything around you. That is all.</p>

<p>But I can tell you right now that I am putting my life on the line for all this. I will go visit you to make sure you understand and know how to be happy. I will stand by you no matter what the situation you are facing to help you up when you are down. I will fly across the globe just to make sure you practice it. Why? Because I know that if your practice enough and you practice correctly it will work. True Happiness will be at your door without even needing to want it. This is the best thing I can do and give to others. So please don't be afraid to talk to me and explore what I have to offer to enrich your life here at True Happiness!</p>

<!-- <p>Depending on how you would like to approach this, you can first start off with laying down the right foundation of happiness or get right into the practice. Either way, you will need <em>both</em>--the right knowledge as well as the right practice--in order to achieve True Happiness, not one or the other.</p>

<!-- <p>Happiness requires work. You need to be an expert at it. You will need to put the theory into practice. Thus, the way to happiness is not one you can read about, but one you experience.</p> -->


<!-- <h2 class="section-heading">What is True Happiness?</h2>

<p>Happiness is when you get what you want. True Happiness when you are satisfied with what you have or in other words you have no more wants. Everything is perfect as is.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What are the causes and conditions of happiness?</h2>

<p>The cause of happiness is the absent of unhappiness. Unhappiness in this case is when what you want from life is not in harmony with what reality is or to put in a simpler term "life is not like what you want."</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">How to attain true happiness?</h2>

<p>Since true happiness is a state of being satisfied with life, one must learn how to be satisfied with what is.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">How to attain true happiness?</h2> -->





<!-- <h2 class="section-heading">The Shortest Version of “How to Be Happy"</h2>
<h2 class="section-heading">The Shortest Version of What This Website has to Offer</h2>

<p>To learn how to be happy is learn how to handle “unhappiness” in life. In reality, it is impossible to always get what you want. Thus, the happiness man alive can’t be someone who always get what he/she wants but instead is someone who has mastered how to handle “unhappiness” in life. Unhappiness in life is caused by dissonance between what you want from life and what is life is. If you are not rich and to want to be rich then you are unhappy. If you want a promotion, but you didn’t get your promotion then you are unhappy. If you want someone to live, but he or she dies then you are unhappy. So the shortest version of “how to be happy” is to learn how to learn how to live with reality, not with what you want from reality.</p>

<p>Another way to rephrase this is to learn how to find contentment in the present moment. If you can learn to be happy in the present moment then it’s no different than learning to be happy forever. Our inability to be satisfied with the now causes us to never be truly satisfied with life. We are always either chasing what we want in the future or what we had in the past. But never fulfilled in the here and now.</p>

<p>Thus, here are <strong>4 simple steps to get you started on this journey toward happiness</strong>:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Identify what’s making you unhappy.</li>
	<p>Usually this is where mindfulness and self-reflection comes into play. But for now a list would do.</p>
	<li>Learn to understand the nature of happiness and unhappiness.</li>
	<li>Learn how to response to “unhappiness” Work at it. See yourself improve. Tell people about it. Find friends who are also learning to be happy.</li>
	<li>Repeat.</li>
</ol> -->

<!-- <h2 class="section-heading">Can I really find True Happiness in this website?</h2>

<p>The answer is yes if you actually put them to use in your daily live. The way to Truth in this website is not what I tell you. The way to Truth in this website is for you to experiment what I tell you in your own live and experience it for yourself </p> -->
