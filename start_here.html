<h2 class="section-heading">The Shortest Version of “How to Be Happy"</h2>

<p>To learn how to be happy is learn how to handle “unhappiness” in life. In reality, it is impossible to always get what you want. Thus, the happiness man alive can’t be someone who always get what he/she wants but instead is someone who has mastered how to handle “unhappiness” in life. Unhappiness in life is caused by dissonance between what you want from life and what is life is. If you are not rich and to want to be rich then you are unhappy. If you want a promotion, but you didn’t get your promotion then you are unhappy. If you want someone to live, but he or she dies then you are unhappy. So the shortest version of “how to be happy” is to learn how to learn how to live with reality, not with what you want from reality.</p>

<p>Another way to rephrase this is to learn how to find contentment in the present moment. If you can learn to be happy in the present moment then it’s no different than learning to be happy forever. Our inability to be satisfied with the now causes us to never be truly satisfied with life. We are always either chasing what we want in the future or what we had in the past. But never fulfilled in the here and now.</p>

<p>Thus, here are <strong>4 simple steps to get you started on this journey toward happiness</strong>:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Identify what’s making you unhappy.</li>
	<li>Learn to understand the nature of happiness and unhappiness and learn how to response to “unhappiness”</li>
	<li>Learn how to response to “unhappiness” Work at it. See yourself improve. Tell people about it. Find friends who are also learning to be happy.</li>
	<li>Repeat</li>
</ol>
