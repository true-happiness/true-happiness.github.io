<h2>2. Supporting My Vision</h2>
<blockquote>“Educating the mind without educating the heart is no education at all.”
- Aristotle</blockquote>

<p>My vision is to open an university.</p>

<p>Education teaches about the truth and nature of many things from smallest insect to vastness of universe. Yet, it never teaches about the truth and nature of the students themselves.</p>

<p>The function of education today is merely to put power in the hands of the students without teaching them how to exercise it. As a result, we have opened up the world where the fortunates could use their fortune to take advantage of those who are less fortunate. Those who received the best education today are judged best on his or her ability to perform more than his or her reason or purpose to perform. Thus, graduating from top universities does not mean he or she will enter the world thinking about how to better it. Theodore Roosevelt once said:</p>

<blockquote>"A man who has never gone to school may steal a freight car; but if he has a university education, he may steal the whole railroad."</blockquote>

<p>Wealth will not stop people from their greed. And more power will not stop people from abusing power. Thus, giving students more power without teaching them how to exercise it is definitely not a good idea. What we need is a holistic approach to education where we do not merely ask the question of what and how. But why?</p>

<p>Why do we study at all? Is it for one's personal ends or is it for the betterment of this world? Students ought to build their "why" to this world as much as the "how" to this world. Because without being able to ask the "why" question, students are left astrayed in the abyss of not knowing why they were born. Why are we all here in this world? And what is the best way of living life, one that is beneficial for both ourselves and for this world?</p>

<p>By developing the knowledge outside of ourselves as well as the knowledge inside of ourselves, this university will grow students who are both capable and compassionate. By learning about life, the students will not only be building their characater but he or she will also know how to find True Happiness in life, something which school rarely taught. Academically, this university should be rigorous. It will drive its academic performance not by the student's grade but how it inspires the student to learn; or in other words, passion.</p>

<blockquote>"Education is the kindling of a flame, not the filling of a vessel." - Socrates</blockquote>

<p>The purpose of education is to help, not to hinder. It's not teach them how to memorize. It is not to evaluate students through standardized tests or exams.  It is not to judge the students and decides or limits who they are and can become. The focus of this school is simply to help the student to learn. And that is exactly what this university will do.</p>

<p>With the right support and the right people, I truly believe that if this university come to life, it will be the best university in the world. It would revolutionize the way education is and has been. It will help change and save many lives. And its student will graduate with the passion to serve and have a strong desire to improve themselves not only for themselves but for all. So if you are interested or want to support the cause, do not hesitate to <a href="/contact">contact</a>.</p>
