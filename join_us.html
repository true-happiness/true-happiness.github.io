<h3>Editor</h3>

<ol>
	<li>be logical e.g people can easily follow what you are trying to say.</li>
	<li>speak the Truth.</li>
	<li>written with compassion to help other people.</li>
	<li>not served your ulterior motives such as fame, money, or any egotistic fulfillment.</li>
	<li>not offend or provoke the readers in any way.</li>
